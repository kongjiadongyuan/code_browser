 * This structure describes a stage set arranged for a particular communication
 * between uKernel (GuC) and Driver (KMD). Technically, this is known as a
 * &quot;GuC Context descriptor&quot; in the specs, but we use the term &quot;stage descriptor&quot;
 * to avoid confusion with all the other things already named &quot;context&quot; in the
 * driver. A static pool of these descriptors are stored inside a GEM object
 * (stage_desc_pool) which is held for the entire lifetime of our interaction
 * with the GuC, being allocated before the GuC is loaded with its firmware.
