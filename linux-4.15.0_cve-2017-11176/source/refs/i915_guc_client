 * This structure primarily describes the GEM object shared with the GuC.
 * The specs sometimes refer to this object as a &quot;GuC context&quot;, but we use
 * the term &quot;client&quot; to avoid confusion with hardware contexts. This
 * GEM object is held for the entire lifetime of our interaction with
 * the GuC, being allocated before the GuC is loaded with its firmware.
 * Because there&apos;s no way to update the address used by the GuC after
 * initialisation, the shared object must stay pinned into the GGTT as
 * long as the GuC is in use. We also keep the first page (only) mapped
 * into kernel address space, as it includes shared data that must be
 * updated on every request submission.
 *
 * The single GEM object described here is actually made up of several
 * separate areas, as far as the GuC is concerned. The first page (kept
 * kmap&apos;d) includes the &quot;process descriptor&quot; which holds sequence data for
 * the doorbell, and one cacheline which actually *is* the doorbell; a
 * write to this will &quot;ring the doorbell&quot; (i.e. send an interrupt to the
 * GuC). The subsequent  pages of the client object constitute the work
 * queue (a circular array of work items), again described in the process
 * descriptor. Work queue pages are mapped momentarily as required.
