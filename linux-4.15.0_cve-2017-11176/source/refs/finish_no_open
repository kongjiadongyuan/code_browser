 * finish_no_open - finish -&gt;atomic_open() without opening the file
 *
 * @file: file pointer
 * @dentry: dentry or NULL (as returned from -&gt;lookup())
 *
 * This can be used to set the result of a successful lookup in -&gt;atomic_open().
 *
 * NB: unlike finish_open() this function does consume the dentry reference and
 * the caller need not dput() it.
 *
 * Returns &quot;1&quot; which must be the return value of -&gt;atomic_open() after having
 * called this function.
