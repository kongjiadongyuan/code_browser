 * ww_mutex_lock_slow_interruptible - slowpath acquiring of the w/w mutex, interruptible
 * @lock: the mutex to be acquired
 * @ctx: w/w acquire context
 *
 * Acquires a w/w mutex with the given context after a wound case. This function
 * will sleep until the lock becomes available and returns 0 when the lock has
 * been acquired. If a signal arrives while waiting for the lock then this
 * function returns -EINTR.
 *
 * The caller must have released all w/w mutexes already acquired with the
 * context and then call this function on the contended lock.
 *
 * Afterwards the caller may continue to (re)acquire the other w/w mutexes it
 * needs with ww_mutex_lock. Note that the -EALREADY return code from
 * ww_mutex_lock can be used to avoid locking this contended mutex twice.
 *
 * It is forbidden to call this function with any other w/w mutexes associated
 * with the given context held. It is forbidden to call this on anything else
 * than the contending mutex.
 *
 * Note that the slowpath lock acquiring can also be done by calling
 * ww_mutex_lock_interruptible directly. This function here is simply to help
 * w/w mutex locking code readability by clearly denoting the slowpath.
