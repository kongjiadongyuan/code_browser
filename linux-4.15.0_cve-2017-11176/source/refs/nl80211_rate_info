 * enum nl80211_rate_info - bitrate information
 *
 * These attribute types are used with %NL80211_STA_INFO_TXRATE
 * when getting information about the bitrate of a station.
 * There are 2 attributes for bitrate, a legacy one that represents
 * a 16-bit value, and new one that represents a 32-bit value.
 * If the rate value fits into 16 bit, both attributes are reported
 * with the same value. If the rate is too high to fit into 16 bits
 * (&gt;6.5535Gbps) only 32-bit attribute is included.
 * User space tools encouraged to use the 32-bit attribute and fall
 * back to the 16-bit one for compatibility with older kernels.
 *
 * @__NL80211_RATE_INFO_INVALID: attribute number 0 is reserved
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_BITRATE: total bitrate (u16, 100kbit/s)
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_MCS: mcs index for 802.11n (u8)
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_40_MHZ_WIDTH: 40 MHz dualchannel bitrate
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_SHORT_GI: 400ns guard interval
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_BITRATE32: total bitrate (u32, 100kbit/s)
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_MAX: highest rate_info number currently defined
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_VHT_MCS: MCS index for VHT (u8)
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_VHT_NSS: number of streams in VHT (u8)
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_80_MHZ_WIDTH: 80 MHz VHT rate
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_80P80_MHZ_WIDTH: unused - 80+80 is treated the
 *	same as 160 for purposes of the bitrates
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_160_MHZ_WIDTH: 160 MHz VHT rate
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_10_MHZ_WIDTH: 10 MHz width - note that this is
 *	a legacy rate and will be reported as the actual bitrate, i.e.
 *	half the base (20 MHz) rate
 * @NL80211_RATE_INFO_5_MHZ_WIDTH: 5 MHz width - note that this is
 *	a legacy rate and will be reported as the actual bitrate, i.e.
 *	a quarter of the base (20 MHz) rate
 * @__NL80211_RATE_INFO_AFTER_LAST: internal use
