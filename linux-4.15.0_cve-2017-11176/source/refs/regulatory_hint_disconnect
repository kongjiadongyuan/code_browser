 * regulatory_hint_disconnect - informs all devices have been disconneted
 *
 * Regulotory rules can be enhanced further upon scanning and upon
 * connection to an AP. These rules become stale if we disconnect
 * and go to another country, whether or not we suspend and resume.
 * If we suspend, go to another country and resume we&apos;ll automatically
 * get disconnected shortly after resuming and things will be reset as well.
 * This routine is a helper to restore regulatory settings to how they were
 * prior to our first connect attempt. This includes ignoring country IE and
 * beacon regulatory hints. The ieee80211_regdom module parameter will always
 * be respected but if a user had set the regulatory domain that will take
 * precedence.
 *
 * Must be called from process context.
