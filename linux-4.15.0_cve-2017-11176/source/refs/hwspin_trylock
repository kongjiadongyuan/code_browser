 * hwspin_trylock() - attempt to lock a specific hwspinlock
 * @hwlock: an hwspinlock which we want to trylock
 *
 * This function attempts to lock an hwspinlock, and will immediately fail
 * if the hwspinlock is already taken.
 *
 * Upon a successful return from this function, preemption is disabled,
 * so the caller must not sleep, and is advised to release the hwspinlock
 * as soon as possible. This is required in order to minimize remote cores
 * polling on the hardware interconnect.
 *
 * Returns 0 if we successfully locked the hwspinlock, -EBUSY if
 * the hwspinlock was already taken, and -EINVAL if @hwlock is invalid.
