 * Each LSM must pass this method before registering its own operations
 * to avoid security registration races. This method may also be used
 * to check if your LSM is currently loaded during kernel initialization.
 *
 * Returns:

 * true if:
 *
 * - The passed LSM is the one chosen by user at boot time,
 * - or the passed LSM is configured as the default and the user did not
 *   choose an alternate LSM at boot time.
 *
 * Otherwise, return false.
