 * enum ieee80211_vif_flags - virtual interface flags
 *
 * @IEEE80211_VIF_BEACON_FILTER: the device performs beacon filtering
 *	on this virtual interface to avoid unnecessary CPU wakeups
 * @IEEE80211_VIF_SUPPORTS_CQM_RSSI: the device can do connection quality
 *	monitoring on this virtual interface -- i.e. it can monitor
 *	connection quality related parameters, such as the RSSI level and
 *	provide notifications if configured trigger levels are reached.
 * @IEEE80211_VIF_SUPPORTS_UAPSD: The device can do U-APSD for this
 *	interface. This flag should be set during interface addition,
 *	but may be set/cleared as late as authentication to an AP. It is
 *	only valid for managed/station mode interfaces.
 * @IEEE80211_VIF_GET_NOA_UPDATE: request to handle NOA attributes
 *	and send P2P_PS notification to the driver if NOA changed, even
 *	this is not pure P2P vif.
