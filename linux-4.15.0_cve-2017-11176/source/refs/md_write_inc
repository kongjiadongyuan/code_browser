<doc f='linux/drivers/md/md.c' l='8081'>/* md_write_inc can only be called when md_write_start() has
 * already been called at least once of the current request.
 * It increments the counter and is useful when a single request
 * is split into several parts.  Each part causes an increment and
 * so needs a matching md_write_end().
 * Unlike md_write_start(), it is safe to call md_write_inc() inside
 * a spinlocked region.
