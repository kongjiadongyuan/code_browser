 * ring_buffer_consume - return an event and consume it
 * @buffer: The ring buffer to get the next event from
 * @cpu: the cpu to read the buffer from
 * @ts: a variable to store the timestamp (may be NULL)
 * @lost_events: a variable to store if events were lost (may be NULL)
 *
 * Returns the next event in the ring buffer, and that event is consumed.
 * Meaning, that sequential reads will keep returning a different event,
 * and eventually empty the ring buffer if the producer is slower.
