 * cfg80211_ibss_joined - notify cfg80211 that device joined an IBSS

 * @channel: the channel of the IBSS joined
 * @gfp: allocation flags
 *
 * This function notifies cfg80211 that the device joined an IBSS or
 * switched to a different BSSID. Before this function can be called,
 * either a beacon has to have been received from the IBSS, or one of
 * the cfg80211_inform_bss{,_frame} functions must have been called
 * with the locally generated beacon -- this guarantees that there is
 * always a scan result for this IBSS. cfg80211 will handle the rest.
