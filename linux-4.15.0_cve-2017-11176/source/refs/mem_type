 * enum mem_type - memory types. For a more detailed reference, please see
 *			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRAM
 *
 * @MEM_EMPTY:		Empty csrow
 * @MEM_RESERVED:	Reserved csrow type
 * @MEM_UNKNOWN:	Unknown csrow type
 * @MEM_FPM:		FPM - Fast Page Mode, used on systems up to 1995.
 * @MEM_EDO:		EDO - Extended data out, used on systems up to 1998.
 * @MEM_BEDO:		BEDO - Burst Extended data out, an EDO variant.
 * @MEM_SDR:		SDR - Single data rate SDRAM
 *			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_dynamic_random-access_memory
 *			They use 3 pins for chip select: Pins 0 and 2 are
 *			for rank 0; pins 1 and 3 are for rank 1, if the memory
 *			is dual-rank.
 * @MEM_RDR:		Registered SDR SDRAM
 * @MEM_DDR:		Double data rate SDRAM
 *			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM
 * @MEM_RDDR:		Registered Double data rate SDRAM
 *			This is a variant of the DDR memories.
 *			A registered memory has a buffer inside it, hiding
 *			part of the memory details to the memory controller.
 * @MEM_RMBS:		Rambus DRAM, used on a few Pentium III/IV controllers.
 * @MEM_DDR2:		DDR2 RAM, as described at JEDEC JESD79-2F.
 *			Those memories are labeled as &quot;PC2-&quot; instead of &quot;PC&quot; to
 *			differentiate from DDR.
 * @MEM_FB_DDR2:	Fully-Buffered DDR2, as described at JEDEC Std No. 205
 *			and JESD206.
 *			Those memories are accessed per DIMM slot, and not by
 *			a chip select signal.
 * @MEM_RDDR2:		Registered DDR2 RAM
 *			This is a variant of the DDR2 memories.
 * @MEM_XDR:		Rambus XDR
 *			It is an evolution of the original RAMBUS memories,
 *			created to compete with DDR2. Weren&apos;t used on any
 *			x86 arch, but cell_edac PPC memory controller uses it.
 * @MEM_DDR3:		DDR3 RAM
 * @MEM_RDDR3:		Registered DDR3 RAM
 *			This is a variant of the DDR3 memories.
 * @MEM_LRDDR3:		Load-Reduced DDR3 memory.
 * @MEM_DDR4:		Unbuffered DDR4 RAM
 * @MEM_RDDR4:		Registered DDR4 RAM
 *			This is a variant of the DDR4 memories.
 * @MEM_LRDDR4:		Load-Reduced DDR4 memory.
