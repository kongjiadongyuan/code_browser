 * Even on processors with invariant TSC, TSC gets reset in some the
 * ACPI system sleep states. And in some systems BIOS seem to reinit TSC to
 * arbitrary value (still sync&apos;d across cpu&apos;s) during resume from such sleep
 * states. To cope up with this, recompute the cyc2ns_offset for each cpu so
 * that sched_clock() continues from the point where it was left off during
 * suspend.
