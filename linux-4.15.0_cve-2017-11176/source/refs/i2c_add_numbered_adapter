 * i2c_add_numbered_adapter - declare i2c adapter, use static bus number
 * @adap: the adapter to register (with adap-&gt;nr initialized)
 * Context: can sleep
 *
 * This routine is used to declare an I2C adapter when its bus number
 * matters.  For example, use it for I2C adapters from system-on-chip CPUs,
 * or otherwise built in to the system&apos;s mainboard, and where i2c_board_info
 * is used to properly configure I2C devices.
 *
 * If the requested bus number is set to -1, then this function will behave
 * identically to i2c_add_adapter, and will dynamically assign a bus number.
 *
 * If no devices have pre-been declared for this bus, then be sure to
 * register the adapter before any dynamically allocated ones.  Otherwise
 * the required bus ID may not be available.
 *
 * When this returns zero, the specified adapter became available for
 * clients using the bus number provided in adap-&gt;nr.  Also, the table
 * of I2C devices pre-declared using i2c_register_board_info() is scanned,
 * and the appropriate driver model device nodes are created.  Otherwise, a
 * negative errno value is returned.
