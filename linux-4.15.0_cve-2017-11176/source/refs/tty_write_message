 * tty_write_message - write a message to a certain tty, not just the console.
 * @tty: the destination tty_struct
 * @msg: the message to write
 *
 * This is used for messages that need to be redirected to a specific tty.
 * We don&apos;t put it into the syslog queue right now maybe in the future if
 * really needed.
 *
 * We must still hold the BTM and test the CLOSING flag for the moment.
