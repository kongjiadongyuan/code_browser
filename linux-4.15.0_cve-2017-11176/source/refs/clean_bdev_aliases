 * clean_bdev_aliases: clean a range of buffers in block device
 * @bdev: Block device to clean buffers in
 * @block: Start of a range of blocks to clean
 * @len: Number of blocks to clean
 *
 * We are taking a range of blocks for data and we don&apos;t want writeback of any
 * buffer-cache aliases starting from return from this function and until the
 * moment when something will explicitly mark the buffer dirty (hopefully that
 * will not happen until we will free that block ;-) We don&apos;t even need to mark
 * it not-uptodate - nobody can expect anything from a newly allocated buffer
 * anyway. We used to use unmap_buffer() for such invalidation, but that was
 * wrong. We definitely don&apos;t want to mark the alias unmapped, for example - it
 * would confuse anyone who might pick it with bread() afterwards...
 *
 * Also..  Note that bforget() doesn&apos;t lock the buffer.  So there can be
 * writeout I/O going on against recently-freed buffers.  We don&apos;t wait on that
 * I/O in bforget() - it&apos;s more efficient to wait on the I/O only if we really
 * need to.  That happens here.
