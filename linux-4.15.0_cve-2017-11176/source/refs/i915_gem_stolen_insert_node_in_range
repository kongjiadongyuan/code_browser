 * The BIOS typically reserves some of the system&apos;s memory for the exclusive
 * use of the integrated graphics. This memory is no longer available for
 * use by the OS and so the user finds that his system has less memory
 * available than he put in. We refer to this memory as stolen.
 *
 * The BIOS will allocate its framebuffer from the stolen memory. Our
 * goal is try to reuse that object for our own fbcon which must always
 * be available for panics. Anything else we can reuse the stolen memory
 * for is a boon.
