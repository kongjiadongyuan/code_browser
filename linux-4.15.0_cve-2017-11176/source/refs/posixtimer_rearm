 * This function is exported for use by the signal deliver code.  It is
 * called just prior to the info block being released and passes that
 * block to us.  It&apos;s function is to update the overrun entry AND to
 * restart the timer.  It should only be called if the timer is to be
 * restarted (i.e. we have flagged this in the sys_private entry of the
 * info block).
 *
 * To protect against the timer going away while the interrupt is queued,
 * we require that the it_requeue_pending flag be set.
