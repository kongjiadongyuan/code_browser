 * cpufreq_suspend() - Suspend CPUFreq governors
 *
 * Called during system wide Suspend/Hibernate cycles for suspending governors
 * as some platforms can&apos;t change frequency after this point in suspend cycle.
 * Because some of the devices (like: i2c, regulators, etc) they use for
 * changing frequency are suspended quickly after this point.
