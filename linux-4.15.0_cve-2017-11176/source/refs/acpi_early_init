 * acpi_early_init - Initialize ACPICA and populate the ACPI namespace.
 *
 * The ACPI tables are accessible after this, but the handling of events has not
 * been initialized and the global lock is not available yet, so AML should not
 * be executed at this point.
 *
 * Doing this before switching the EFI runtime services to virtual mode allows
 * the EfiBootServices memory to be freed slightly earlier on boot.
