 * lowpan_header_compress - replace IPv6 header with 6LoWPAN header
 *
 * This function replaces the IPv6 header which should be pointed at
 * skb-&gt;data and skb_network_header, with the IPHC 6LoWPAN header.
 * The caller need to be sure that the sk buffer is not shared and at have
 * at least a headroom which is smaller or equal LOWPAN_IPHC_MAX_HEADER_LEN,
 * which is the IPHC &quot;more bytes than IPv6 header&quot; at worst case.
 *
 * @skb: the buffer which should be manipulate.
 * @dev: the lowpan net device pointer.
 * @daddr: destination lladdr of mac header which is used for compression
 *	methods.
 * @saddr: source lladdr of mac header which is used for compression
 *	methods.
