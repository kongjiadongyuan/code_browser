 * event_trace_add_tracer - add a instance of a trace_array to events
 * @parent: The parent dentry to place the files/directories for events in
 * @tr: The trace array associated with these events
 *
 * When a new instance is created, it needs to set up its events
 * directory, as well as other files associated with events. It also
 * creates the event hierachry in the @parent/events directory.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success.
 *
 * Must be called with event_mutex held.
