 * enum nl80211_bss_select_attr - attributes for bss selection.
 *
 * @__NL80211_BSS_SELECT_ATTR_INVALID: reserved.
 * @NL80211_BSS_SELECT_ATTR_RSSI: Flag indicating only RSSI-based BSS selection
 *	is requested.
 * @NL80211_BSS_SELECT_ATTR_BAND_PREF: attribute indicating BSS
 *	selection should be done such that the specified band is preferred.
 *	When there are multiple BSS-es in the preferred band, the driver
 *	shall use RSSI-based BSS selection as a second step. The value of
 *	this attribute is according to &amp;enum nl80211_band (u32).
 * @NL80211_BSS_SELECT_ATTR_RSSI_ADJUST: When present the RSSI level for
 *	BSS-es in the specified band is to be adjusted before doing
 *	RSSI-based BSS selection. The attribute value is a packed structure
 *	value as specified by &amp;struct nl80211_bss_select_rssi_adjust.
 * @NL80211_BSS_SELECT_ATTR_MAX: highest bss select attribute number.
 * @__NL80211_BSS_SELECT_ATTR_AFTER_LAST: internal use.
 *
 * One and only one of these attributes are found within %NL80211_ATTR_BSS_SELECT
 * for %NL80211_CMD_CONNECT. It specifies the required BSS selection behaviour
 * which the driver shall use.
