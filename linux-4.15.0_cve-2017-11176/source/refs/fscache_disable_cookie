 *
 * Disable a cookie from accepting further alloc, read, write, invalidate,

 * upon and pages can still be uncached and the cookie relinquished.
 *
 * This will not return until all outstanding operations have completed.

 * If @invalidate is set, then the backing object will be invalidated and
 * detached, otherwise it will just be detached.
