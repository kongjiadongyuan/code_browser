 * tick_nohz_idle_enter - stop the idle tick from the idle task
 *
 * When the next event is more than a tick into the future, stop the idle tick
 * Called when we start the idle loop.

 * The arch is responsible of calling:
 *
 * - rcu_idle_enter() after its last use of RCU before the CPU is put
 *  to sleep.
 * - rcu_idle_exit() before the first use of RCU after the CPU is woken up.
