 * rcu_irq_exit - inform RCU that current CPU is exiting irq towards idle
 *
 * Exit from an interrupt handler, which might possibly result in entering
 * idle mode, in other words, leaving the mode in which read-side critical
 * sections can occur.  The caller must have disabled interrupts.
 *
 * This code assumes that the idle loop never does anything that might
 * result in unbalanced calls to irq_enter() and irq_exit().  If your
 * architecture violates this assumption, RCU will give you what you
 * deserve, good and hard.  But very infrequently and irreproducibly.
 *
 * Use things like work queues to work around this limitation.
 *
 * You have been warned.
 *
 * If you add or remove a call to rcu_irq_exit(), be sure to test with
 * CONFIG_RCU_EQS_DEBUG=y.
