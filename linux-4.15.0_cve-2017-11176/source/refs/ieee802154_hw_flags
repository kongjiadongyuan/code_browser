 * enum ieee802154_hw_flags - hardware flags
 *
 * These flags are used to indicate hardware capabilities to
 * the stack. Generally, flags here should have their meaning
 * done in a way that the simplest hardware doesn&apos;t need setting
 * any particular flags. There are some exceptions to this rule,
 * however, so you are advised to review these flags carefully.
 *
 * @IEEE802154_HW_TX_OMIT_CKSUM: Indicates that xmitter will add FCS on it&apos;s
 *	own.
 *
 * @IEEE802154_HW_LBT: Indicates that transceiver will support listen before
 *	transmit.
 *
 * @IEEE802154_HW_CSMA_PARAMS: Indicates that transceiver will support csma
 *	parameters (max_be, min_be, backoff exponents).
 *
 * @IEEE802154_HW_FRAME_RETRIES: Indicates that transceiver will support ARET
 *	frame retries setting.
 *
 * @IEEE802154_HW_AFILT: Indicates that transceiver will support hardware
 *	address filter setting.
 *
 * @IEEE802154_HW_PROMISCUOUS: Indicates that transceiver will support
 *	promiscuous mode setting.
 *
 * @IEEE802154_HW_RX_OMIT_CKSUM: Indicates that receiver omits FCS.
 *
 * @IEEE802154_HW_RX_DROP_BAD_CKSUM: Indicates that receiver will not filter
 *	frames with bad checksum.
