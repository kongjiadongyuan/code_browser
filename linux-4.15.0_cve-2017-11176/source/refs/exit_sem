 * add semadj values to semaphores, free undo structures.
 * undo structures are not freed when semaphore arrays are destroyed
 * so some of them may be out of date.
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: There is some confusion over whether the
 * set of adjustments that needs to be done should be done in an atomic
 * manner or not. That is, if we are attempting to decrement the semval
 * should we queue up and wait until we can do so legally?
 * The original implementation attempted to do this (queue and wait).
 * The current implementation does not do so. The POSIX standard
 * and SVID should be consulted to determine what behavior is mandated.
