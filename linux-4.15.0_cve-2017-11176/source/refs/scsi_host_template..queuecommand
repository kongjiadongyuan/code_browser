	 * The queuecommand function is used to queue up a scsi
	 * command block to the LLDD.  When the driver finished
	 * processing the command the done callback is invoked.
	 *
	 * If queuecommand returns 0, then the HBA has accepted the
	 * command.  The done() function must be called on the command
	 * when the driver has finished with it. (you may call done on the
	 * command before queuecommand returns, but in this case you
	 * *must* return 0 from queuecommand).
	 *
	 * Queuecommand may also reject the command, in which case it may
	 * not touch the command and must not call done() for it.
	 *
	 * There are two possible rejection returns:
	 *
	 *   SCSI_MLQUEUE_DEVICE_BUSY: Block this device temporarily, but
	 *   allow commands to other devices serviced by this host.
	 *
	 *   SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY: Block all devices served by this
	 *   host temporarily.
	 *
         * For compatibility, any other non-zero return is treated the
         * same as SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY.
	 *
	 * NOTE: &quot;temporarily&quot; means either until the next command for#
	 * this device/host completes, or a period of time determined by
	 * I/O pressure in the system if there are no other outstanding
	 * commands.
	 *
	 * STATUS: REQUIRED
