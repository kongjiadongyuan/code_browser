 * Unfair double_lock_balance: Optimizes throughput at the expense of
 * latency by eliminating extra atomic operations when the locks are
 * already in proper order on entry.  This favors lower cpu-ids and will
 * grant the double lock to lower cpus over higher ids under contention,
 * regardless of entry order into the function.
