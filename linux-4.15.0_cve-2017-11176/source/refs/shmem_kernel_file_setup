 * shmem_kernel_file_setup - get an unlinked file living in tmpfs which must be
 * 	kernel internal.  There will be NO LSM permission checks against the
 * 	underlying inode.  So users of this interface must do LSM checks at a
 *	higher layer.  The users are the big_key and shm implementations.  LSM
 *	checks are provided at the key or shm level rather than the inode.
 * @name: name for dentry (to be seen in /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps
 * @size: size to be set for the file
 * @flags: VM_NORESERVE suppresses pre-accounting of the entire object size
