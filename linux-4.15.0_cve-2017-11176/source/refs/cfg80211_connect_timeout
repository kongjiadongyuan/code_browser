 * cfg80211_connect_timeout - notify cfg80211 of connection timeout
 *
 * @dev: network device
 * @bssid: the BSSID of the AP
 * @req_ie: association request IEs (maybe be %NULL)
 * @req_ie_len: association request IEs length
 * @gfp: allocation flags
 * @timeout_reason: reason for connection timeout.
 *
 * It should be called by the underlying driver whenever connect() has failed
 * in a sequence where no explicit authentication/association rejection was
 * received from the AP. This could happen, e.g., due to not being able to send
 * out the Authentication or Association Request frame or timing out while
 * waiting for the response. Only one of the functions among
 * cfg80211_connect_bss(), cfg80211_connect_result(),
 * cfg80211_connect_timeout(), and cfg80211_connect_done() should be called.
