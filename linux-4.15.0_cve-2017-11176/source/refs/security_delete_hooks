 * Assuring the safety of deleting a security module is up to
 * the security module involved. This may entail ordering the
 * module&apos;s hook list in a particular way, refusing to disable
 * the module once a policy is loaded or any number of other
 * actions better imagined than described.
 *
 * The name of the configuration option reflects the only module
 * that currently uses the mechanism. Any developer who thinks
 * disabling their module is a good idea needs to be at least as
 * careful as the SELinux team.
