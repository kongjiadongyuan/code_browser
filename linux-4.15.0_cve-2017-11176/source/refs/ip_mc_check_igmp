 * ip_mc_check_igmp - checks whether this is a sane IGMP packet
 * @skb: the skb to validate
 * @skb_trimmed: to store an skb pointer trimmed to IPv4 packet tail (optional)
 *
 * Checks whether an IPv4 packet is a valid IGMP packet. If so sets
 * skb transport header accordingly and returns zero.
 *
 * -EINVAL: A broken packet was detected, i.e. it violates some internet
 *  standard
 * -ENOMSG: IP header validation succeeded but it is not an IGMP packet.
 * -ENOMEM: A memory allocation failure happened.
 *
 * Optionally, an skb pointer might be provided via skb_trimmed (or set it
 * to NULL): After parsing an IGMP packet successfully it will point to
 * an skb which has its tail aligned to the IP packet end. This might
 * either be the originally provided skb or a trimmed, cloned version if
 * the skb frame had data beyond the IP packet. A cloned skb allows us
 * to leave the original skb and its full frame unchanged (which might be
 * desirable for layer 2 frame jugglers).
 *
 * Caller needs to set the skb network header and free any returned skb if it
 * differs from the provided skb.
