 * rhltable_walk_enter - Initialise an iterator
 * @hlt:	Table to walk over
 * @iter:	Hash table Iterator
 *
 * This function prepares a hash table walk.
 *
 * Note that if you restart a walk after rhashtable_walk_stop you
 * may see the same object twice.  Also, you may miss objects if
 * there are removals in between rhashtable_walk_stop and the next
 * call to rhashtable_walk_start.
 *
 * For a completely stable walk you should construct your own data
 * structure outside the hash table.
 *
 * This function may sleep so you must not call it from interrupt
 * context or with spin locks held.
 *
 * You must call rhashtable_walk_exit after this function returns.
