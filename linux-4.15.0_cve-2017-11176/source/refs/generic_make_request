 * generic_make_request - hand a buffer to its device driver for I/O
 * @bio:  The bio describing the location in memory and on the device.
 *
 * generic_make_request() is used to make I/O requests of block
 * devices. It is passed a &amp;struct bio, which describes the I/O that needs
 * to be done.
 *
 * generic_make_request() does not return any status.  The
 * success/failure status of the request, along with notification of
 * completion, is delivered asynchronously through the bio-&gt;bi_end_io
 * function described (one day) else where.
 *
 * The caller of generic_make_request must make sure that bi_io_vec
 * are set to describe the memory buffer, and that bi_dev and bi_sector are
 * set to describe the device address, and the
 * bi_end_io and optionally bi_private are set to describe how
 * completion notification should be signaled.
 *
 * generic_make_request and the drivers it calls may use bi_next if this
 * bio happens to be merged with someone else, and may resubmit the bio to
 * a lower device by calling into generic_make_request recursively, which
 * means the bio should NOT be touched after the call to -&gt;make_request_fn.
