 * Reenable a previously disabled cookie, allowing it to accept further alloc,
 * read, write, invalidate, update or acquire operations.  An attempt will be
 * made to immediately reattach the cookie to a backing object.

 * The can_enable() function is called (if not NULL) once the enablement lock
