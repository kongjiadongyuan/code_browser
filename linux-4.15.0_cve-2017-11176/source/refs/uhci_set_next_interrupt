 * Technically, updating td-&gt;status here is a race, but it&apos;s not really a
 * problem. The worst that can happen is that we set the IOC bit again
 * generating a spurious interrupt. We could fix this by creating another
 * QH and leaving the IOC bit always set, but then we would have to play
 * games with the FSBR code to make sure we get the correct order in all
 * the cases. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth the effort
