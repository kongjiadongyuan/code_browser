 * enum drm_plane_type - uapi plane type enumeration
 *
 * For historical reasons not all planes are made the same. This enumeration is
 * used to tell the different types of planes apart to implement the different
 * uapi semantics for them. For userspace which is universal plane aware and
 * which is using that atomic IOCTL there&apos;s no difference between these planes
 * (beyong what the driver and hardware can support of course).
 *
 * For compatibility with legacy userspace, only overlay planes are made
 * available to userspace by default. Userspace clients may set the
 * DRM_CLIENT_CAP_UNIVERSAL_PLANES client capability bit to indicate that they
 * wish to receive a universal plane list containing all plane types. See also
 * drm_for_each_legacy_plane().
 *
 * WARNING: The values of this enum is UABI since they&apos;re exposed in the &quot;type&quot;
 * property.
