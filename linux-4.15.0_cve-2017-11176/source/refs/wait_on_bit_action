<doc f='linux/include/linux/wait_bit.h' l='141'>/**
 * wait_on_bit_action - wait for a bit to be cleared
 * @word: the word being waited on, a kernel virtual address
 * @bit: the bit of the word being waited on
 * @action: the function used to sleep, which may take special actions
 * @mode: the task state to sleep in
 *
 * Use the standard hashed waitqueue table to wait for a bit
 * to be cleared, and allow the waiting action to be specified.
 * This is like wait_on_bit() but allows fine control of how the waiting
 * is done.
 *
 * Returned value will be zero if the bit was cleared, or non-zero
 * if the process received a signal and the mode permitted wakeup
 * on that signal.
