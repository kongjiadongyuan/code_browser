 * direct_make_request - hand a buffer directly to its device driver for I/O
 * @bio:  The bio describing the location in memory and on the device.
 *
 * This function behaves like generic_make_request(), but does not protect
 * against recursion.  Must only be used if the called driver is known
 * to not call generic_make_request (or direct_make_request) again from
 * its make_request function.  (Calling direct_make_request again from
 * a workqueue is perfectly fine as that doesn&apos;t recurse).
