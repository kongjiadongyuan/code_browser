 * The global memory commitment made in the system can be a metric
 * that can be used to drive ballooning decisions when Linux is hosted
 * as a guest. On Hyper-V, the host implements a policy engine for dynamically
 * balancing memory across competing virtual machines that are hosted.
 * Several metrics drive this policy engine including the guest reported
 * memory commitment.
