 * Targeted preemption latency for CPU-bound tasks:
 *
 * NOTE: this latency value is not the same as the concept of
 * &apos;timeslice length&apos; - timeslices in CFS are of variable length
 * and have no persistent notion like in traditional, time-slice
 * based scheduling concepts.
 *
 * (to see the precise effective timeslice length of your workload,
 *  run vmstat and monitor the context-switches (cs) field)
 *
 * (default: 6ms * (1 + ilog(ncpus)), units: nanoseconds)
