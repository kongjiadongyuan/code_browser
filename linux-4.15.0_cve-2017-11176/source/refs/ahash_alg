 * struct ahash_alg - asynchronous message digest definition
 * @init: Initialize the transformation context. Intended only to initialize the
 *	  state of the HASH transformation at the beginning. This shall fill in
 *	  the internal structures used during the entire duration of the whole
 *	  transformation. No data processing happens at this point.
 *	  Note: mandatory.
 * @update: Push a chunk of data into the driver for transformation. This
 *	   function actually pushes blocks of data from upper layers into the
 *	   driver, which then passes those to the hardware as seen fit. This
 *	   function must not finalize the HASH transformation by calculating the
 *	   final message digest as this only adds more data into the
 *	   transformation. This function shall not modify the transformation
 *	   context, as this function may be called in parallel with the same
 *	   transformation object. Data processing can happen synchronously
 *	   [SHASH] or asynchronously [AHASH] at this point.
 *	   Note: mandatory.
 * @final: Retrieve result from the driver. This function finalizes the
 *	   transformation and retrieves the resulting hash from the driver and
 *	   pushes it back to upper layers. No data processing happens at this
 *	   point unless hardware requires it to finish the transformation
 *	   (then the data buffered by the device driver is processed).
 *	   Note: mandatory.
 * @finup: Combination of @update and @final. This function is effectively a
 *	   combination of @update and @final calls issued in sequence. As some
 *	   hardware cannot do @update and @final separately, this callback was
 *	   added to allow such hardware to be used at least by IPsec. Data
 *	   processing can happen synchronously [SHASH] or asynchronously [AHASH]
 *	   at this point.
 *	   Note: optional.
 * @digest: Combination of @init and @update and @final. This function
 *	    effectively behaves as the entire chain of operations, @init,
 *	    @update and @final issued in sequence. Just like @finup, this was
 *	    added for hardware which cannot do even the @finup, but can only do
 *	    the whole transformation in one run. Data processing can happen
 *	    synchronously [SHASH] or asynchronously [AHASH] at this point.
 * @setkey: Set optional key used by the hashing algorithm. Intended to push
 *	    optional key used by the hashing algorithm from upper layers into
 *	    the driver. This function can store the key in the transformation
 *	    context or can outright program it into the hardware. In the former
 *	    case, one must be careful to program the key into the hardware at
 *	    appropriate time and one must be careful that .setkey() can be
 *	    called multiple times during the existence of the transformation
 *	    object. Not  all hashing algorithms do implement this function as it
 *	    is only needed for keyed message digests. SHAx/MDx/CRCx do NOT
 *	    implement this function. HMAC(MDx)/HMAC(SHAx)/CMAC(AES) do implement
 *	    this function. This function must be called before any other of the
 *	    @init, @update, @final, @finup, @digest is called. No data
 *	    processing happens at this point.
 * @export: Export partial state of the transformation. This function dumps the
 *	    entire state of the ongoing transformation into a provided block of
 *	    data so it can be @import &apos;ed back later on. This is useful in case
 *	    you want to save partial result of the transformation after
 *	    processing certain amount of data and reload this partial result
 *	    multiple times later on for multiple re-use. No data processing
 *	    happens at this point.
 * @import: Import partial state of the transformation. This function loads the
 *	    entire state of the ongoing transformation from a provided block of
 *	    data so the transformation can continue from this point onward. No
 *	    data processing happens at this point.
