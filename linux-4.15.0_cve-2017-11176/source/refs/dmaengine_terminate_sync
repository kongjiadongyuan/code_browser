 * dmaengine_terminate_sync() - Terminate all active DMA transfers
 * @chan: The channel for which to terminate the transfers
 *
 * Calling this function will terminate all active and pending transfers
 * that have previously been submitted to the channel. It is similar to
 * dmaengine_terminate_async() but guarantees that the DMA transfer has actually
 * stopped and that all complete callbacks have finished running when the
 * function returns.
 *
 * This function must only be called from non-atomic context and must not be
 * called from within a complete callback of a descriptor submitted on the same
 * channel.
