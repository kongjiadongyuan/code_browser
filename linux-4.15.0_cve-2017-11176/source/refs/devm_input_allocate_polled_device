 * devm_input_allocate_polled_device - allocate managed polled device
 * @dev: device owning the polled device being created
 *
 * Returns prepared &amp;struct input_polled_dev or %NULL.
 *
 * Managed polled input devices do not need to be explicitly unregistered
 * or freed as it will be done automatically when owner device unbinds
 * from * its driver (or binding fails). Once such managed polled device
 * is allocated, it is ready to be set up and registered in the same
 * fashion as regular polled input devices (using
 * input_register_polled_device() function).
 *
 * If you want to manually unregister and free such managed polled devices,
 * it can be still done by calling input_unregister_polled_device() and
 * input_free_polled_device(), although it is rarely needed.
 *
 * NOTE: the owner device is set up as parent of input device and users
 * should not override it.
