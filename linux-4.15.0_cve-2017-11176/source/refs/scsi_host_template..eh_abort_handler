	 * This is an error handling strategy routine.  You don&apos;t need to
	 * define one of these if you don&apos;t want to - there is a default
	 * routine that is present that should work in most cases.  For those
	 * driver authors that have the inclination and ability to write their
	 * own strategy routine, this is where it is specified.  Note - the
	 * strategy routine is *ALWAYS* run in the context of the kernel eh
	 * thread.  Thus you are guaranteed to *NOT* be in an interrupt
	 * handler when you execute this, and you are also guaranteed to
	 * *NOT* have any other commands being queued while you are in the
	 * strategy routine. When you return from this function, operations
	 * return to normal.
	 *
	 * See scsi_error.c scsi_unjam_host for additional comments about
	 * what this function should and should not be attempting to do.
	 *
	 * Status: REQUIRED	(at least one of them)
