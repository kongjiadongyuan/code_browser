 * dma_fence_add_callback - add a callback to be called when the fence
 * is signaled
 * @fence:	[in]	the fence to wait on
 * @cb:		[in]	the callback to register
 * @func:	[in]	the function to call
 *
 * cb will be initialized by dma_fence_add_callback, no initialization
 * by the caller is required. Any number of callbacks can be registered
 * to a fence, but a callback can only be registered to one fence at a time.
 *
 * Note that the callback can be called from an atomic context.  If
 * fence is already signaled, this function will return -ENOENT (and
 * *not* call the callback)
 *
 * Add a software callback to the fence. Same restrictions apply to
 * refcount as it does to dma_fence_wait, however the caller doesn&apos;t need to
 * keep a refcount to fence afterwards: when software access is enabled,
 * the creator of the fence is required to keep the fence alive until
 * after it signals with dma_fence_signal. The callback itself can be called
 * from irq context.
 *
 * Returns 0 in case of success, -ENOENT if the fence is already signaled
 * and -EINVAL in case of error.
