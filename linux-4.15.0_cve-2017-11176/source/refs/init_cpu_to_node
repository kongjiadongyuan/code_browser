 * Setup early cpu_to_node.
 *
 * Populate cpu_to_node[] only if x86_cpu_to_apicid[],
 * and apicid_to_node[] tables have valid entries for a CPU.
 * This means we skip cpu_to_node[] initialisation for NUMA
 * emulation and faking node case (when running a kernel compiled
 * for NUMA on a non NUMA box), which is OK as cpu_to_node[]
 * is already initialized in a round robin manner at numa_init_array,
 * prior to this call, and this initialization is good enough
 * for the fake NUMA cases.
 *
 * Called before the per_cpu areas are setup.
