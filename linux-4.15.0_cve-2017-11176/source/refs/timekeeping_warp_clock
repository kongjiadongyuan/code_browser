 * Adjust the time obtained from the CMOS to be UTC time instead of
 * local time.
 *
 * This is ugly, but preferable to the alternatives.  Otherwise we
 * would either need to write a program to do it in /etc/rc (and risk
 * confusion if the program gets run more than once; it would also be
 * hard to make the program warp the clock precisely n hours)  or
 * compile in the timezone information into the kernel.  Bad, bad....

 * The best thing to do is to keep the CMOS clock in universal time (UTC)
 * as real UNIX machines always do it. This avoids all headaches about
 * daylight saving times and warping kernel clocks.
