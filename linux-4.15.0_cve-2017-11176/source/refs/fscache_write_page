 * fscache_write_page - Request storage of a page in the cache
 * @cookie: The cookie representing the cache object
 * @page: The netfs page to store
 * @gfp: The conditions under which memory allocation should be made
 *
 * Request the contents of the netfs page be written into the cache.  This
 * request may be ignored if no cache block is currently allocated, in which
 * case it will return -ENOBUFS.
 *
 * If a cache block was already allocated, a write will be initiated and 0 will
 * be returned.  The PG_fscache_write page bit is set immediately and will then
 * be cleared at the completion of the write to indicate the success or failure
 * of the operation.  Note that the completion may happen before the return.
 *
 * See Documentation/filesystems/caching/netfs-api.txt for a complete
 * description.
