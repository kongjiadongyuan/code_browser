 * enum ieee80211_conf_flags - configuration flags
 *
 * Flags to define PHY configuration options
 *
 * @IEEE80211_CONF_MONITOR: there&apos;s a monitor interface present -- use this
 *	to determine for example whether to calculate timestamps for packets
 *	or not, do not use instead of filter flags!
 * @IEEE80211_CONF_PS: Enable 802.11 power save mode (managed mode only).
 *	This is the power save mode defined by IEEE 802.11-2007 section 11.2,
 *	meaning that the hardware still wakes up for beacons, is able to
 *	transmit frames and receive the possible acknowledgment frames.
 *	Not to be confused with hardware specific wakeup/sleep states,
 *	driver is responsible for that. See the section &quot;Powersave support&quot;
 *	for more.
 * @IEEE80211_CONF_IDLE: The device is running, but idle; if the flag is set
 *	the driver should be prepared to handle configuration requests but
 *	may turn the device off as much as possible. Typically, this flag will
 *	be set when an interface is set UP but not associated or scanning, but
 *	it can also be unset in that case when monitor interfaces are active.
 * @IEEE80211_CONF_OFFCHANNEL: The device is currently not on its main
 *	operating channel.
