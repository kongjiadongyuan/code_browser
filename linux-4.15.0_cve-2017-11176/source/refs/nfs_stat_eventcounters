 * NFS event counters
 *
 * These counters provide a low-overhead way of monitoring client
 * activity without enabling NFS trace debugging.  The counters
 * show the rate at which VFS requests are made, and how often the
 * client invalidates its data and attribute caches.  This allows
 * system administrators to monitor such things as how close-to-open
 * is working, and answer questions such as &quot;why are there so many
 * GETATTR requests on the wire?&quot;
 *
 * They also count anamolous events such as short reads and writes,
 * silly renames due to close-after-delete, and operations that
 * change the size of a file (such operations can often be the
 * source of data corruption if applications aren&apos;t using file
 * locking properly).
