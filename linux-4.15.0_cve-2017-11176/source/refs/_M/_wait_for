 * _wait_for - magic (register) wait macro
 *
 * Does the right thing for modeset paths when run under kdgb or similar atomic
 * contexts. Note that it&apos;s important that we check the condition again after
 * having timed out, since the timeout could be due to preemption or similar and
 * we&apos;ve never had a chance to check the condition before the timeout.
 *
 * TODO: When modesetting has fully transitioned to atomic, the below
 * drm_can_sleep() can be removed and in_atomic()/!in_atomic() asserts
 * added.
