 * We are planning to be backward and forward compatible with changes
 * to the event struct, by adding new, optional, members at the end.
 * When reading an event (whether the kernel from userspace or vice
 * versa) we need to accept anything that&apos;s at least as large as the
 * version 1 event size, but might be able to accept other sizes in
 * the future.
 *
 * One exception is the kernel -- we already have two event sizes in
 * that we&apos;ve made the &apos;hard&apos; member optional since our only option
 * is to ignore it anyway.
