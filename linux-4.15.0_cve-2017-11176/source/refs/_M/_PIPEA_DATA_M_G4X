 * Computing GMCH M and N values for the Display Port link
 *
 * GMCH M/N = dot clock * bytes per pixel / ls_clk * # of lanes
 *
 * ls_clk (we assume) is the DP link clock (1.62 or 2.7 GHz)
 *
 * The GMCH value is used internally
 *
 * bytes_per_pixel is the number of bytes coming out of the plane,
 * which is after the LUTs, so we want the bytes for our color format.
 * For our current usage, this is always 3, one byte for R, G and B.
