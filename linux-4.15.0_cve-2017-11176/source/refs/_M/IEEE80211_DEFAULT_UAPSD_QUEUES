 * Some APs experience problems when working with U-APSD. Decreasing the
 * probability of that happening by using legacy mode for all ACs but VO isn&apos;t
 * enough.
 *
 * Cisco 4410N originally forced us to enable VO by default only because it
 * treated non-VO ACs as legacy.
 *
 * However some APs (notably Netgear R7000) silently reclassify packets to
 * different ACs. Since u-APSD ACs require trigger frames for frame retrieval
 * clients would never see some frames (e.g. ARP responses) or would fetch them
 * accidentally after a long time.
 *
 * It makes little sense to enable u-APSD queues by default because it needs
 * userspace applications to be aware of it to actually take advantage of the
 * possible additional powersavings. Implicitly depending on driver autotrigger
 * frame support doesn&apos;t make much sense.
