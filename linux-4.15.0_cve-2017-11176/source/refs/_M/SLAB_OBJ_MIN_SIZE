 * This restriction comes from byte sized index implementation.
 * Page size is normally 2^12 bytes and, in this case, if we want to use
 * byte sized index which can represent 2^8 entries, the size of the object
 * should be equal or greater to 2^12 / 2^8 = 2^4 = 16.
 * If minimum size of kmalloc is less than 16, we use it as minimum object
 * size and give up to use byte sized index.
