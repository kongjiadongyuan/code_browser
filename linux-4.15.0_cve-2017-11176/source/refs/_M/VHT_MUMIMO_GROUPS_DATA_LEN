 * DOC: Actions and configuration
 *
 * Each wireless device and each virtual interface offer a set of configuration
 * operations and other actions that are invoked by userspace. Each of these
 * actions is described in the operations structure, and the parameters these
 * operations use are described separately.
 *
 * Additionally, some operations are asynchronous and expect to get status
 * information via some functions that drivers need to call.
 *
 * Scanning and BSS list handling with its associated functionality is described
 * in a separate chapter.
