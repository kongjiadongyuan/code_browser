 * Older kernels (&lt; 4.9) on big-endian systems produced broken free space tree
 * bitmaps, and btrfs-progs also used to corrupt the free space tree (versions
 * &lt; 4.7.3).  If this bit is clear, then the free space tree cannot be trusted.
 * btrfs-progs can also intentionally clear this bit to ask the kernel to
 * rebuild the free space tree, however this might not work on older kernels
 * that do not know about this bit. If not sure, clear the cache manually on
 * first mount when booting older kernel versions.
