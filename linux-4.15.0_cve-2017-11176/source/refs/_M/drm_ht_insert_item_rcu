 * The user of this API needs to make sure that two or more instances of the
 * hash table manipulation functions are never run simultaneously.
 * The lookup function drm_ht_find_item_rcu may, however, run simultaneously
 * with any of the manipulation functions as long as it&apos;s called from within
 * an RCU read-locked section.
