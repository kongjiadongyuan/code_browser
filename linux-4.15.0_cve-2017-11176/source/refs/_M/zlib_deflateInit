     This function adds the data at next_in (avail_in bytes) to the output
   history without performing any output.  There must be no pending output,
   and the decompressor must be expecting to see the start of a block.
   Calling this function is equivalent to decompressing a stored block
   containing the data at next_in (except that the data is not output).
