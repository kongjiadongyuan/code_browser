 * When hitting ptrace_stop(), we cannot return using SYSRET because
 * that does not restore the full CPU state, only a minimal set.  The
 * ptracer can change arbitrary register values, which is usually okay
 * because the usual ptrace stops run off the signal delivery path which
 * forces IRET; however, ptrace_event() stops happen in arbitrary places
 * in the kernel and don&apos;t force IRET path.
 *
 * So force IRET path after a ptrace stop.
