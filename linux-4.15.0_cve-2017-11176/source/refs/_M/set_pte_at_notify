 * set_pte_at_notify() sets the pte _after_ running the notifier.
 * This is safe to start by updating the secondary MMUs, because the primary MMU
 * pte invalidate must have already happened with a ptep_clear_flush() before
 * set_pte_at_notify() has been invoked.  Updating the secondary MMUs first is
 * required when we change both the protection of the mapping from read-only to
 * read-write and the pfn (like during copy on write page faults). Otherwise the
 * old page would remain mapped readonly in the secondary MMUs after the new
 * page is already writable by some CPU through the primary MMU.
