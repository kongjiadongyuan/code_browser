<doc f='linux/drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_drv.h' l='4221'>/* Be very careful with read/write 64-bit values. On 32-bit machines, they
 * will be implemented using 2 32-bit writes in an arbitrary order with
 * an arbitrary delay between them. This can cause the hardware to
 * act upon the intermediate value, possibly leading to corruption and
 * machine death. For this reason we do not support I915_WRITE64, or
 * dev_priv-&gt;uncore.funcs.mmio_writeq.
 *
 * When reading a 64-bit value as two 32-bit values, the delay may cause
 * the two reads to mismatch, e.g. a timestamp overflowing. Also note that
 * occasionally a 64-bit register does not actualy support a full readq
 * and must be read using two 32-bit reads.
 *
 * You have been warned.
