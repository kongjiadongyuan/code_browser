 * tlb_remove_tlb_entry - remember a pte unmapping for later tlb invalidation.
 *
 * Record the fact that pte&apos;s were really unmapped by updating the range,
 * so we can later optimise away the tlb invalidate.   This helps when
 * userspace is unmapping already-unmapped pages, which happens quite a lot.
