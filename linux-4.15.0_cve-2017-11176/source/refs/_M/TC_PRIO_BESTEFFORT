<doc f='linux/include/uapi/linux/pkt_sched.h' l='7'>/* Logical priority bands not depending on specific packet scheduler.
   Every scheduler will map them to real traffic classes, if it has
   no more precise mechanism to classify packets.

   These numbers have no special meaning, though their coincidence
   with obsolete IPv6 values is not occasional :-). New IPv6 drafts
   preferred full anarchy inspired by diffserv group.

   Note: TC_PRIO_BESTEFFORT does not mean that it is the most unhappy
   class, actually, as rule it will be handled with more care than
   filler or even bulk.
