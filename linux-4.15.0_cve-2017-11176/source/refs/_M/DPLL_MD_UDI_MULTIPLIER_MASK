 * SDVO/UDI pixel multiplier.
 *
 * SDVO requires that the bus clock rate be between 1 and 2 Ghz, and the bus
 * clock rate is 10 times the DPLL clock.  At low resolution/refresh rate
 * modes, the bus rate would be below the limits, so SDVO allows for stuffing
 * dummy bytes in the datastream at an increased clock rate, with both sides of
 * the link knowing how many bytes are fill.
 *
 * So, for a mode with a dotclock of 65Mhz, we would want to double the clock
 * rate to 130Mhz to get a bus rate of 1.30Ghz.  The DPLL clock rate would be
 * set to 130Mhz, and the SDVO multiplier set to 2x in this register and
 * through an SDVO command.
 *
 * This register field has values of multiplication factor minus 1, with
 * a maximum multiplier of 5 for SDVO.
