 * This flag is for ENGINEs who return new duplicate structures when found
 * via &quot;ENGINE_by_id()&quot;. When an ENGINE must store state (eg. if
 * ENGINE_ctrl() commands are called in sequence as part of some stateful
 * process like key-generation setup and execution), it can set this flag -
 * then each attempt to obtain the ENGINE will result in it being copied into
 * a new structure. Normally, ENGINEs don&apos;t declare this flag so
 * ENGINE_by_id() just increments the existing ENGINE&apos;s structural reference
 * count.
