 * ring_buffer_lock_reserve - reserve a part of the buffer
 * @buffer: the ring buffer to reserve from
 * @length: the length of the data to reserve (excluding event header)
 *
 * Returns a reseverd event on the ring buffer to copy directly to.
 * The user of this interface will need to get the body to write into
 * and can use the ring_buffer_event_data() interface.
 *
 * The length is the length of the data needed, not the event length
 * which also includes the event header.
 *
 * Must be paired with ring_buffer_unlock_commit, unless NULL is returned.
 * If NULL is returned, then nothing has been allocated or locked.
