	 * @init_oa_buffer: Resets the head and tail pointers of the
	 * circular buffer for periodic OA reports.
	 *
	 * Called when first opening a stream for OA metrics, but also may be
	 * called in response to an OA buffer overflow or other error
	 * condition.
	 *
	 * Note it may be necessary to clear the full OA buffer here as part of
	 * maintaining the invariable that new reports must be written to
	 * zeroed memory for us to be able to reliable detect if an expected
	 * report has not yet landed in memory.  (At least on Haswell the OA
	 * buffer tail pointer is not synchronized with reports being visible
	 * to the CPU)
