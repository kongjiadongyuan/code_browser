 * unpause_named_trigger - Un-pause all named triggers with the same name
 * @data: The trigger data of a named trigger to unpause
 *
 * Un-pauses a named trigger along with all other triggers having the

 * unpausing only one is meaningless, so unpausing one named trigger
 * needs to unpause all triggers with the same name.
