 * finish_mkwrite_fault - finish page fault for a shared mapping, making PTE
 *			  writeable once the page is prepared
 *
 * @vmf: structure describing the fault
 *
 * This function handles all that is needed to finish a write page fault in a
 * shared mapping due to PTE being read-only once the mapped page is prepared.
 * It handles locking of PTE and modifying it. The function returns
 * VM_FAULT_WRITE on success, 0 when PTE got changed before we acquired PTE
 * lock.
 *
 * The function expects the page to be locked or other protection against
 * concurrent faults / writeback (such as DAX radix tree locks).
