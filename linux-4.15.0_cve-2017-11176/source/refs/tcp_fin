 * 	Process the FIN bit. This now behaves as it is supposed to work
 *	and the FIN takes effect when it is validly part of sequence
 *	space. Not before when we get holes.
 *
 *	If we are ESTABLISHED, a received fin moves us to CLOSE-WAIT
 *	(and thence onto LAST-ACK and finally, CLOSE, we never enter
 *	TIME-WAIT)
 *
 *	If we are in FINWAIT-1, a received FIN indicates simultaneous
 *	close and we go into CLOSING (and later onto TIME-WAIT)
 *
 *	If we are in FINWAIT-2, a received FIN moves us to TIME-WAIT.
