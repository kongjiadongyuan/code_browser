 * wait_on_bit_timeout - wait for a bit to be cleared or a timeout elapses
 * @word: the word being waited on, a kernel virtual address
 * @bit: the bit of the word being waited on
 * @mode: the task state to sleep in
 * @timeout: timeout, in jiffies
 *
 * Use the standard hashed waitqueue table to wait for a bit
 * to be cleared. This is similar to wait_on_bit(), except also takes a
 * timeout parameter.
 *
 * Returned value will be zero if the bit was cleared before the
 * @timeout elapsed, or non-zero if the @timeout elapsed or process
 * received a signal and the mode permitted wakeup on that signal.
