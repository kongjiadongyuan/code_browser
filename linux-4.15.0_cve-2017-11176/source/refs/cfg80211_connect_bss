 * cfg80211_connect_bss - notify cfg80211 of connection result
 *
 * @dev: network device
 * @bssid: the BSSID of the AP
 * @bss: entry of bss to which STA got connected to, can be obtained
 *	through cfg80211_get_bss (may be %NULL)
 * @req_ie: association request IEs (maybe be %NULL)
 * @req_ie_len: association request IEs length
 * @resp_ie: association response IEs (may be %NULL)
 * @resp_ie_len: assoc response IEs length
 * @status: status code, %WLAN_STATUS_SUCCESS for successful connection, use
 *	%WLAN_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED_FAILURE if your device cannot give you
 *	the real status code for failures. If this call is used to report a
 *	failure due to a timeout (e.g., not receiving an Authentication frame
 *	from the AP) instead of an explicit rejection by the AP, -1 is used to
 *	indicate that this is a failure, but without a status code.
 *	@timeout_reason is used to report the reason for the timeout in that
 *	case.
 * @gfp: allocation flags
 * @timeout_reason: reason for connection timeout. This is used when the
 *	connection fails due to a timeout instead of an explicit rejection from
 *	the AP. %NL80211_TIMEOUT_UNSPECIFIED is used when the timeout reason is
 *	not known. This value is used only if @status &lt; 0 to indicate that the
 *	failure is due to a timeout and not due to explicit rejection by the AP.
 *	This value is ignored in other cases (@status &gt;= 0).
 *
 * It should be called by the underlying driver once execution of the connection
 * request from connect() has been completed. This is similar to
 * cfg80211_connect_result(), but with the option of identifying the exact bss
 * entry for the connection. Only one of the functions among
 * cfg80211_connect_bss(), cfg80211_connect_result(),
 * cfg80211_connect_timeout(), and cfg80211_connect_done() should be called.
