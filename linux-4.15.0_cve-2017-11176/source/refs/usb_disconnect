 * usb_disconnect - disconnect a device (usbcore-internal)
 * @pdev: pointer to device being disconnected
 * Context: !in_interrupt ()
 *
 * Something got disconnected. Get rid of it and all of its children.
 *
 * If *pdev is a normal device then the parent hub must already be locked.
 * If *pdev is a root hub then the caller must hold the usb_bus_idr_lock,
 * which protects the set of root hubs as well as the list of buses.
 *
 * Only hub drivers (including virtual root hub drivers for host
 * controllers) should ever call this.
 *
 * This call is synchronous, and may not be used in an interrupt context.
