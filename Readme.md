## Some Code pages

Here are some source code I'm interested in.
All of these pages are generated by woboq code browser:

https://github.com/woboq/woboq_codebrowser

And thanks to this dockerfile:

https://github.com/skysider/glibc_browser



### How to use

Just copy the folder into the webserver's directory. Take Apache and xv6's source code as example:

```bash
sudo cp -r /path/to/repo/xv6 /var/www/html/
```

And make sure your Apache service is okay.

Now the url must be:

http://yourip/xv6/source

Notice that the second part of url depends on the folders name in /path/to/repo/xv6:

```
ls /path/to/repo/xv6
    data source
ls /path/to/repo/libc2.23
    data glibc
```

And I'll update it according to my own needs.

GL.
