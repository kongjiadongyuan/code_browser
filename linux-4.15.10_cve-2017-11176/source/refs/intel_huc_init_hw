 * @huc: intel_huc structure
 *
 * Called from guc_setup() during driver loading and also after a GPU reset.
 * Be note that HuC loading must be done before GuC loading.
 *
 * The firmware image should have already been fetched into memory by the
 * earlier call to intel_huc_init(), so here we need only check that
 * is succeeded, and then transfer the image to the h/w.
