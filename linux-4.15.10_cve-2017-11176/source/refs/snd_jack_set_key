 * snd_jack_set_key - Set a key mapping on a jack
 *
 * @jack:    The jack to configure
 * @type:    Jack report type for this key
 * @keytype: Input layer key type to be reported
 *
 * Map a SND_JACK_BTN_* button type to an input layer key, allowing
 * reporting of keys on accessories via the jack abstraction.  If no
 * mapping is provided but keys are enabled in the jack type then
 * BTN_n numeric buttons will be reported.
 *
 * If jacks are not reporting via the input API this call will have no
 * effect.
 *
 * Note that this is intended to be use by simple devices with small
 * numbers of keys that can be reported.  It is also possible to
 * access the input device directly - devices with complex input
 * capabilities on accessories should consider doing this rather than
 * using this abstraction.
 *
 * This function may only be called prior to registration of the jack.
 *
 * Return: Zero if successful, or a negative error code on failure.
