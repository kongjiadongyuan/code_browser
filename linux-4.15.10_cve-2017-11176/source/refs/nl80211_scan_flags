 * enum nl80211_scan_flags -  scan request control flags
 *
 * Scan request control flags are used to control the handling
 * of NL80211_CMD_TRIGGER_SCAN and NL80211_CMD_START_SCHED_SCAN
 * requests.
 *
 * @NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_LOW_PRIORITY: scan request has low priority
 * @NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_FLUSH: flush cache before scanning
 * @NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_AP: force a scan even if the interface is configured
 *	as AP and the beaconing has already been configured. This attribute is
 *	dangerous because will destroy stations performance as a lot of frames
 *	will be lost while scanning off-channel, therefore it must be used only
 *	when really needed
 * @NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_RANDOM_ADDR: use a random MAC address for this scan (or
 *	for scheduled scan: a different one for every scan iteration). When the
 *	flag is set, depending on device capabilities the @NL80211_ATTR_MAC and
 *	@NL80211_ATTR_MAC_MASK attributes may also be given in which case only
 *	the masked bits will be preserved from the MAC address and the remainder
 *	randomised. If the attributes are not given full randomisation (46 bits,
 *	locally administered 1, multicast 0) is assumed.
 *	This flag must not be requested when the feature isn&apos;t supported, check
 *	the nl80211 feature flags for the device.
 * @NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_FILS_MAX_CHANNEL_TIME: fill the dwell time in the FILS
 *	request parameters IE in the probe request
 * @NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_ACCEPT_BCAST_PROBE_RESP: accept broadcast probe responses
 * @NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_OCE_PROBE_REQ_HIGH_TX_RATE: send probe request frames at
 *	rate of at least 5.5M. In case non OCE AP is dicovered in the channel,
 *	only the first probe req in the channel will be sent in high rate.
 * @NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_OCE_PROBE_REQ_DEFERRAL_SUPPRESSION: allow probe request
 *	tx deferral (dot11FILSProbeDelay shall be set to 15ms)
 *	and suppression (if it has received a broadcast Probe Response frame,
 *	Beacon frame or FILS Discovery frame from an AP that the STA considers
 *	a suitable candidate for (re-)association - suitable in terms of
 *	SSID and/or RSSI
