 * i915_syncmap_is_later -- compare against the last know sync point
 * @root - pointer to the #i915_syncmap
 * @id - the context id (other timeline) we are synchronising to
 * @seqno - the sequence number along the other timeline
 *
 * If we have already synchronised this @root timeline with another (@id) then
 * we can omit any repeated or earlier synchronisation requests. If the two
 * timelines are already coupled, we can also omit the dependency between the
 * two as that is already known via the timeline.
 *
 * Returns true if the two timelines are already synchronised wrt to @seqno,
 * false if not and the synchronisation must be emitted.
