 *
 * If DSACK is received, increment reo_wnd by min_rtt/4 (upper bounded
 * by srtt), since there is possibility that spurious retransmission was
 * due to reordering delay longer than reo_wnd.
 *
 * Persist the current reo_wnd value for TCP_RACK_RECOVERY_THRESH (16)
 * no. of successful recoveries (accounts for full DSACK-based loss
 * recovery undo). After that, reset it to default (min_rtt/4).
 *
 * At max, reo_wnd is incremented only once per rtt. So that the new
 * DSACK on which we are reacting, is due to the spurious retx (approx)
 * after the reo_wnd has been updated last time.
 *
 * reo_wnd is tracked in terms of steps (of min_rtt/4), rather than
 * absolute value to account for change in rtt.
