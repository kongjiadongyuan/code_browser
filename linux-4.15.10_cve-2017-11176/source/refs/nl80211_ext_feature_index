 * enum nl80211_ext_feature_index - bit index of extended features.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_VHT_IBSS: This driver supports IBSS with VHT datarates.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_RRM: This driver supports RRM. When featured, user can
 *	can request to use RRM (see %NL80211_ATTR_USE_RRM) with
 *	%NL80211_CMD_ASSOCIATE and %NL80211_CMD_CONNECT requests, which will set
 *	the ASSOC_REQ_USE_RRM flag in the association request even if
 *	NL80211_FEATURE_QUIET is not advertized.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_MU_MIMO_AIR_SNIFFER: This device supports MU-MIMO air
 *	sniffer which means that it can be configured to hear packets from
 *	certain groups which can be configured by the
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_MU_MIMO_GROUP_DATA attribute,
 *	or can be configured to follow a station by configuring the
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_MU_MIMO_FOLLOW_MAC_ADDR attribute.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_SCAN_START_TIME: This driver includes the actual
 *	time the scan started in scan results event. The time is the TSF of
 *	the BSS that the interface that requested the scan is connected to
 *	(if available).
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_BSS_PARENT_TSF: Per BSS, this driver reports the
 *	time the last beacon/probe was received. The time is the TSF of the
 *	BSS that the interface that requested the scan is connected to
 *	(if available).
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_SET_SCAN_DWELL: This driver supports configuration of
 *	channel dwell time.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_BEACON_RATE_LEGACY: Driver supports beacon rate
 *	configuration (AP/mesh), supporting a legacy (non HT/VHT) rate.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_BEACON_RATE_HT: Driver supports beacon rate
 *	configuration (AP/mesh) with HT rates.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_BEACON_RATE_VHT: Driver supports beacon rate
 *	configuration (AP/mesh) with VHT rates.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_FILS_STA: This driver supports Fast Initial Link Setup
 *	with user space SME (NL80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE) in station mode.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_MGMT_TX_RANDOM_TA: This driver supports randomized TA
 *	in @NL80211_CMD_FRAME while not associated.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_MGMT_TX_RANDOM_TA_CONNECTED: This driver supports
 *	randomized TA in @NL80211_CMD_FRAME while associated.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_SCHED_SCAN_RELATIVE_RSSI: The driver supports sched_scan
 *	for reporting BSSs with better RSSI than the current connected BSS
 *	(%NL80211_ATTR_SCHED_SCAN_RELATIVE_RSSI).
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_CQM_RSSI_LIST: With this driver the
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_CQM_RSSI_THOLD attribute accepts a list of zero or more
 *	RSSI threshold values to monitor rather than exactly one threshold.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_FILS_SK_OFFLOAD: Driver SME supports FILS shared key
 *	authentication with %NL80211_CMD_CONNECT.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_4WAY_HANDSHAKE_STA_PSK: Device wants to do 4-way
 *	handshake with PSK in station mode (PSK is passed as part of the connect
 *	and associate commands), doing it in the host might not be supported.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_4WAY_HANDSHAKE_STA_1X: Device wants to do doing 4-way
 *	handshake with 802.1X in station mode (will pass EAP frames to the host
 *	and accept the set_pmk/del_pmk commands), doing it in the host might not
 *	be supported.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_FILS_MAX_CHANNEL_TIME: Driver is capable of overriding
 *	the max channel attribute in the FILS request params IE with the
 *	actual dwell time.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_ACCEPT_BCAST_PROBE_RESP: Driver accepts broadcast probe
 *	response
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_OCE_PROBE_REQ_HIGH_TX_RATE: Driver supports sending
 *	the first probe request in each channel at rate of at least 5.5Mbps.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_OCE_PROBE_REQ_DEFERRAL_SUPPRESSION: Driver supports
 *	probe request tx deferral and suppression
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_MFP_OPTIONAL: Driver supports the %NL80211_MFP_OPTIONAL
 *	value in %NL80211_ATTR_USE_MFP.
 *
 * @NUM_NL80211_EXT_FEATURES: number of extended features.
 * @MAX_NL80211_EXT_FEATURES: highest extended feature index.
