 * These functions are useful for manufacturing new ENGINE structures. They
 * don&apos;t address reference counting at all - one uses them to populate an
 * ENGINE structure with personalised implementations of things prior to
 * using it directly or adding it to the builtin ENGINE list in OpenSSL.
 * These are also here so that the ENGINE structure doesn&apos;t have to be
 * exposed and break binary compatibility!
