 * cfg80211_rx_mgmt - notification of received, unprocessed management frame
 * @wdev: wireless device receiving the frame
 * @freq: Frequency on which the frame was received in MHz
 * @sig_dbm: signal strength in mBm, or 0 if unknown
 * @buf: Management frame (header + body)
 * @len: length of the frame data
 * @flags: flags, as defined in enum nl80211_rxmgmt_flags
 *
 * This function is called whenever an Action frame is received for a station
 * mode interface, but is not processed in kernel.
 *
 * Return: %true if a user space application has registered for this frame.
 * For action frames, that makes it responsible for rejecting unrecognized
 * action frames; %false otherwise, in which case for action frames the
 * driver is responsible for rejecting the frame.
