 * i915_gem_revoke_fences - revoke fence state
 * @dev_priv: i915 device private
 *
 * Removes all GTT mmappings via the fence registers. This forces any user
 * of the fence to reacquire that fence before continuing with their access.
 * One use is during GPU reset where the fence register is lost and we need to
 * revoke concurrent userspace access via GTT mmaps until the hardware has been
 * reset and the fence registers have been restored.
