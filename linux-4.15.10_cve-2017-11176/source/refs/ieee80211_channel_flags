 * enum ieee80211_channel_flags - channel flags
 *
 * Channel flags set by the regulatory control code.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_CHAN_DISABLED: This channel is disabled.
 * @IEEE80211_CHAN_NO_IR: do not initiate radiation, this includes
 * 	sending probe requests or beaconing.
 * @IEEE80211_CHAN_RADAR: Radar detection is required on this channel.
 * @IEEE80211_CHAN_NO_HT40PLUS: extension channel above this channel
 * 	is not permitted.
 * @IEEE80211_CHAN_NO_HT40MINUS: extension channel below this channel
 * 	is not permitted.
 * @IEEE80211_CHAN_NO_OFDM: OFDM is not allowed on this channel.
 * @IEEE80211_CHAN_NO_80MHZ: If the driver supports 80 MHz on the band,
 *	this flag indicates that an 80 MHz channel cannot use this
 *	channel as the control or any of the secondary channels.
 *	This may be due to the driver or due to regulatory bandwidth
 *	restrictions.
 * @IEEE80211_CHAN_NO_160MHZ: If the driver supports 160 MHz on the band,
 *	this flag indicates that an 160 MHz channel cannot use this
 *	channel as the control or any of the secondary channels.
 *	This may be due to the driver or due to regulatory bandwidth
 *	restrictions.
 * @IEEE80211_CHAN_INDOOR_ONLY: see %NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_INDOOR_ONLY
 * @IEEE80211_CHAN_IR_CONCURRENT: see %NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_IR_CONCURRENT
 * @IEEE80211_CHAN_NO_20MHZ: 20 MHz bandwidth is not permitted
 *	on this channel.
 * @IEEE80211_CHAN_NO_10MHZ: 10 MHz bandwidth is not permitted
 *	on this channel.
