 * enum nl80211_meshconf_params - mesh configuration parameters
 *
 * Mesh configuration parameters. These can be changed while the mesh is
 * active.
 *
 * @__NL80211_MESHCONF_INVALID: internal use
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_RETRY_TIMEOUT: specifies the initial retry timeout in
 *	millisecond units, used by the Peer Link Open message
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_CONFIRM_TIMEOUT: specifies the initial confirm timeout, in
 *	millisecond units, used by the peer link management to close a peer link
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_HOLDING_TIMEOUT: specifies the holding timeout, in
 *	millisecond units
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_MAX_PEER_LINKS: maximum number of peer links allowed
 *	on this mesh interface
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_MAX_RETRIES: specifies the maximum number of peer link
 *	open retries that can be sent to establish a new peer link instance in a
 *	mesh
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_TTL: specifies the value of TTL field set at a source mesh
 *	point.
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_AUTO_OPEN_PLINKS: whether we should automatically open
 *	peer links when we detect compatible mesh peers. Disabled if
 *	@NL80211_MESH_SETUP_USERSPACE_MPM or @NL80211_MESH_SETUP_USERSPACE_AMPE are
 *	set.
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_HWMP_MAX_PREQ_RETRIES: the number of action frames
 *	containing a PREQ that an MP can send to a particular destination (path
 *	target)
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_PATH_REFRESH_TIME: how frequently to refresh mesh paths
 *	(in milliseconds)
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_MIN_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT: minimum length of time to wait
 *	until giving up on a path discovery (in milliseconds)
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_HWMP_ACTIVE_PATH_TIMEOUT: The time (in TUs) for which mesh
 *	points receiving a PREQ shall consider the forwarding information from
 *	the root to be valid. (TU = time unit)
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_HWMP_PREQ_MIN_INTERVAL: The minimum interval of time (in
 *	TUs) during which an MP can send only one action frame containing a PREQ
 *	reference element
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_HWMP_NET_DIAM_TRVS_TIME: The interval of time (in TUs)
 *	that it takes for an HWMP information element to propagate across the
 *	mesh
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_HWMP_ROOTMODE: whether root mode is enabled or not
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_ELEMENT_TTL: specifies the value of TTL field set at a
 *	source mesh point for path selection elements.
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_HWMP_RANN_INTERVAL:  The interval of time (in TUs) between
 *	root announcements are transmitted.
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_GATE_ANNOUNCEMENTS: Advertise that this mesh station has
 *	access to a broader network beyond the MBSS.  This is done via Root
 *	Announcement frames.
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_HWMP_PERR_MIN_INTERVAL: The minimum interval of time (in
 *	TUs) during which a mesh STA can send only one Action frame containing a
 *	PERR element.
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_FORWARDING: set Mesh STA as forwarding or non-forwarding
 *	or forwarding entity (default is TRUE - forwarding entity)
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_RSSI_THRESHOLD: RSSI threshold in dBm. This specifies the
 *	threshold for average signal strength of candidate station to establish
 *	a peer link.
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_SYNC_OFFSET_MAX_NEIGHBOR: maximum number of neighbors
 *	to synchronize to for 11s default synchronization method
 *	(see 11C.12.2.2)
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_HT_OPMODE: set mesh HT protection mode.
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_ATTR_MAX: highest possible mesh configuration attribute
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_HWMP_PATH_TO_ROOT_TIMEOUT: The time (in TUs) for
 *	which mesh STAs receiving a proactive PREQ shall consider the forwarding
 *	information to the root mesh STA to be valid.
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_HWMP_ROOT_INTERVAL: The interval of time (in TUs) between
 *	proactive PREQs are transmitted.
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_HWMP_CONFIRMATION_INTERVAL: The minimum interval of time
 *	(in TUs) during which a mesh STA can send only one Action frame
 *	containing a PREQ element for root path confirmation.
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_POWER_MODE: Default mesh power mode for new peer links.
 *	type &amp;enum nl80211_mesh_power_mode (u32)
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_AWAKE_WINDOW: awake window duration (in TUs)
 *
 * @NL80211_MESHCONF_PLINK_TIMEOUT: If no tx activity is seen from a STA we&apos;ve
 *	established peering with for longer than this time (in seconds), then
 *	remove it from the STA&apos;s list of peers. You may set this to 0 to disable
 *	the removal of the STA. Default is 30 minutes.
