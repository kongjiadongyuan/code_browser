 * If CPU has died properly, set its state to CPU_UP_PREPARE and
 * return success.  Otherwise, return -EBUSY if the CPU died after
 * cpu_wait_death() timed out.  And yet otherwise again, return -EAGAIN
 * if cpu_wait_death() timed out and the CPU still hasn&apos;t gotten around
 * to dying.  In the latter two cases, the CPU might not be set up
 * properly, but it is up to the arch-specific code to decide.
 * Finally, -EIO indicates an unanticipated problem.
 *
 * Note that it is permissible to omit this call entirely, as is
 * done in architectures that do no CPU-hotplug error checking.
