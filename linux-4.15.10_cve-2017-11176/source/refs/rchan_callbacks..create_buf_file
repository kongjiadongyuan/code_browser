	 * create_buf_file - create file to represent a relay channel buffer
	 * @filename: the name of the file to create
	 * @parent: the parent of the file to create
	 * @mode: the mode of the file to create
	 * @buf: the channel buffer
	 * @is_global: outparam - set non-zero if the buffer should be global
	 *
	 * Called during relay_open(), once for each per-cpu buffer,
	 * to allow the client to create a file to be used to
	 * represent the corresponding channel buffer.  If the file is
	 * created outside of relay, the parent must also exist in
	 * that filesystem.
	 *
	 * The callback should return the dentry of the file created
	 * to represent the relay buffer.
	 *
	 * Setting the is_global outparam to a non-zero value will
	 * cause relay_open() to create a single global buffer rather
	 * than the default set of per-cpu buffers.
	 *
	 * See Documentation/filesystems/relay.txt for more info.
