 * snd_ctl_add_slave_uncached - Add a virtual slave control
 * @master: vmaster element
 * @slave: slave element to add
 *
 * Add a virtual slave control to the given master.
 * Unlike snd_ctl_add_slave(), the element added via this function
 * is supposed to have volatile values, and get callback is called
 * at each time queried from the master.
 *
 * When the control peeks the hardware values directly and the value
 * can be changed by other means than the put callback of the element,
 * this function should be used to keep the value always up-to-date.
 *
 * Return: Zero if successful or a negative error code.
