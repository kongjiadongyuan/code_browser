 * __read_seqcount_begin - begin a seq-read critical section (without barrier)
 * @s: pointer to seqcount_t
 * Returns: count to be passed to read_seqcount_retry
 *
 * __read_seqcount_begin is like read_seqcount_begin, but has no smp_rmb()
 * barrier. Callers should ensure that smp_rmb() or equivalent ordering is
 * provided before actually loading any of the variables that are to be
 * protected in this critical section.
 *
 * Use carefully, only in critical code, and comment how the barrier is
 * provided.
