 * Determine various intel_device_info fields at runtime.

 * Use it when either:
 *   - it&apos;s judged too laborious to fill n static structures with the limit
 *     when a simple if statement does the job,
 *   - run-time checks (eg read fuse/strap registers) are needed.
 *
 * This function needs to be called:
 *   - after the MMIO has been setup as we are reading registers,
 *   - after the PCH has been detected,
 *   - before the first usage of the fields it can tweak.
