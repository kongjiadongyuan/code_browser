 * The following function is used to store a pointer to user-specific data.
 * Any previous such pointer will be returned and replaced.
 *
 * For callback purposes, this function makes a lot more sense than using
 * ex_data, since the latter requires that different parts of OpenSSL or
 * applications share the same ex_data index.
 *
 * Note that the UI_OpenSSL() method completely ignores the user data. Other
 * methods may not, however.
