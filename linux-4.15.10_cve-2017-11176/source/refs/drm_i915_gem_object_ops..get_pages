	 * get_pages() is called once prior to the use of the associated set
	 * of pages before to binding them into the GTT, and put_pages() is
	 * called after we no longer need them. As we expect there to be
	 * associated cost with migrating pages between the backing storage
	 * and making them available for the GPU (e.g. clflush), we may hold
	 * onto the pages after they are no longer referenced by the GPU
	 * in case they may be used again shortly (for example migrating the
	 * pages to a different memory domain within the GTT). put_pages()
	 * will therefore most likely be called when the object itself is
	 * being released or under memory pressure (where we attempt to
	 * reap pages for the shrinker).
