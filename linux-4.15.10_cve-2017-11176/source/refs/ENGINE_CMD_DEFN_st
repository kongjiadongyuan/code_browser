 * If an ENGINE supports its own specific control commands and wishes the
 * framework to handle the above &apos;ENGINE_CMD_***&apos;-manipulation commands on
 * its behalf, it should supply a null-terminated array of ENGINE_CMD_DEFN
 * entries to ENGINE_set_cmd_defns(). It should also implement a ctrl()
 * handler that supports the stated commands (ie. the &quot;cmd_num&quot; entries as
 * described by the array). NB: The array must be ordered in increasing order
 * of cmd_num. &quot;null-terminated&quot; means that the last ENGINE_CMD_DEFN element
 * has cmd_num set to zero and/or cmd_name set to NULL.
