 * clk_disable must not sleep, which differentiates it from clk_unprepare.  In
 * a simple case, clk_disable can be used instead of clk_unprepare to gate a
 * clk if the operation is fast and will never sleep.  One example is a
 * SoC-internal clk which is controlled via simple register writes.  In the
 * complex case a clk gate operation may require a fast and a slow part.  It is
 * this reason that clk_unprepare and clk_disable are not mutually exclusive.
 * In fact clk_disable must be called before clk_unprepare.
