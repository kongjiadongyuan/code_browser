 * Call this when reinitializing a CPU.  It fixes the following potential
 * problems:
 *
 * - The ASID changed from what cpu_tlbstate thinks it is (most likely
 *   because the CPU was taken down and came back up with CR3&apos;s PCID
 *   bits clear.  CPU hotplug can do this.
 *
 * - The TLB contains junk in slots corresponding to inactive ASIDs.
 *
 * - The CPU went so far out to lunch that it may have missed a TLB
 *   flush.
