 * Send parameterised control commands to the engine. The possibilities to
 * send down an integer, a pointer to data or a function pointer are
 * provided. Any of the parameters may or may not be NULL, depending on the
 * command number. In actuality, this function only requires a structural
 * (rather than functional) reference to an engine, but many control commands
 * may require the engine be functional. The caller should be aware of trying
 * commands that require an operational ENGINE, and only use functional
 * references in such situations.
