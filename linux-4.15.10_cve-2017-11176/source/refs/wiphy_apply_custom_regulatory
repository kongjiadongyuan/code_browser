 * wiphy_apply_custom_regulatory - apply a custom driver regulatory domain
 * @wiphy: the wireless device we want to process the regulatory domain on
 * @regd: the custom regulatory domain to use for this wiphy
 *
 * Drivers can sometimes have custom regulatory domains which do not apply
 * to a specific country. Drivers can use this to apply such custom regulatory
 * domains. This routine must be called prior to wiphy registration. The
 * custom regulatory domain will be trusted completely and as such previous
 * default channel settings will be disregarded. If no rule is found for a
 * channel on the regulatory domain the channel will be disabled.
 * Drivers using this for a wiphy should also set the wiphy flag
 * REGULATORY_CUSTOM_REG or cfg80211 will set it for the wiphy
 * that called this helper.
