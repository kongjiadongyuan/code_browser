 * dma_fence_is_signaled_locked - Return an indication if the fence
 *                                is signaled yet.
 * @fence:	[in]	the fence to check
 *
 * Returns true if the fence was already signaled, false if not. Since this
 * function doesn&apos;t enable signaling, it is not guaranteed to ever return
 * true if dma_fence_add_callback, dma_fence_wait or
 * dma_fence_enable_sw_signaling haven&apos;t been called before.
 *
 * This function requires fence-&gt;lock to be held.
