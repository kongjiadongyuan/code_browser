 *	tty_throttle_safe	-	flow control
 *	@tty: terminal
 *
 *	Similar to tty_throttle() but will only attempt throttle
 *	if tty-&gt;flow_change is TTY_THROTTLE_SAFE. Prevents an accidental
 *	throttle due to race conditions when throttling is conditional
 *	on factors evaluated prior to throttling.
 *
 *	Returns 0 if tty is throttled (or was already throttled)
