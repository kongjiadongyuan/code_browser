 * intel_atomic_setup_scalers() - setup scalers for crtc per staged requests
 * @dev_priv: i915 device
 * @crtc: intel crtc
 * @crtc_state: incoming crtc_state to validate and setup scalers
 *
 * This function sets up scalers based on staged scaling requests for
 * a @crtc and its planes. It is called from crtc level check path. If request
 * is a supportable request, it attaches scalers to requested planes and crtc.
 *
 * This function takes into account the current scaler(s) in use by any planes
 * not being part of this atomic state
 *
 *  Returns:
 *         0 - scalers were setup succesfully
 *         error code - otherwise
