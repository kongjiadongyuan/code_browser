	 * Device info:
	 * If TV is present, it&apos;ll be at devices[0].
	 * LVDS will be next, either devices[0] or [1], if present.
	 * On some platforms the number of device is 6. But could be as few as
	 * 4 if both TV and LVDS are missing.
	 * And the device num is related with the size of general definition
	 * block. It is obtained by using the following formula:
	 * number = (block_size - sizeof(bdb_general_definitions))/
	 *	     defs-&gt;child_dev_size;
