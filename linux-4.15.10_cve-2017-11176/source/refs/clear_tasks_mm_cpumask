 * clear_tasks_mm_cpumask - Safely clear tasks&apos; mm_cpumask for a CPU
 * @cpu: a CPU id
 *
 * This function walks all processes, finds a valid mm struct for each one and
 * then clears a corresponding bit in mm&apos;s cpumask.  While this all sounds
 * trivial, there are various non-obvious corner cases, which this function
 * tries to solve in a safe manner.
 *
 * Also note that the function uses a somewhat relaxed locking scheme, so it may
 * be called only for an already offlined CPU.
