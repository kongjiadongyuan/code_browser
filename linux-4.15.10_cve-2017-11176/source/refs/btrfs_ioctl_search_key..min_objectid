	 * When doing a tree search, we&apos;re actually taking a slice from a
	 * linear search space of 136-bit keys.
	 *
	 * A full 136-bit tree key is composed as:
	 *   (objectid &lt;&lt; 72) + (type &lt;&lt; 64) + offset
	 *
	 * The individual min and max values for objectid, type and offset
	 * define the min_key and max_key values for the search range. All
	 * metadata items with a key in the interval [min_key, max_key] will be
	 * returned.
	 *
	 * Additionally, we can filter the items returned on transaction id of
	 * the metadata block they&apos;re stored in by specifying a transid range.
	 * Be aware that this transaction id only denotes when the metadata
	 * page that currently contains the item got written the last time as
	 * result of a COW operation.  The number does not have any meaning
	 * related to the transaction in which an individual item that is being
	 * returned was created or changed.
