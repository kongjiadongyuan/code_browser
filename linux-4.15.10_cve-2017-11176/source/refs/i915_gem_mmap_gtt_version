 * i915_gem_mmap_gtt_version - report the current feature set for GTT mmaps
 *
 * A history of the GTT mmap interface:
 *
 * 0 - Everything had to fit into the GTT. Both parties of a memcpy had to
 *     aligned and suitable for fencing, and still fit into the available
 *     mappable space left by the pinned display objects. A classic problem
 *     we called the page-fault-of-doom where we would ping-pong between
 *     two objects that could not fit inside the GTT and so the memcpy
 *     would page one object in at the expense of the other between every
 *     single byte.
 *
 * 1 - Objects can be any size, and have any compatible fencing (X Y, or none
 *     as set via i915_gem_set_tiling() [DRM_I915_GEM_SET_TILING]). If the
 *     object is too large for the available space (or simply too large
 *     for the mappable aperture!), a view is created instead and faulted
 *     into userspace. (This view is aligned and sized appropriately for
 *     fenced access.)
 *
 * 2 - Recognise WC as a separate cache domain so that we can flush the
 *     delayed writes via GTT before performing direct access via WC.
 *
 * Restrictions:
 *
 *  * snoopable objects cannot be accessed via the GTT. It can cause machine
 *    hangs on some architectures, corruption on others. An attempt to service
 *    a GTT page fault from a snoopable object will generate a SIGBUS.
 *
 *  * the object must be able to fit into RAM (physical memory, though no
 *    limited to the mappable aperture).
 *
 *
 * Caveats:
 *
 *  * a new GTT page fault will synchronize rendering from the GPU and flush
 *    all data to system memory. Subsequent access will not be synchronized.
 *
 *  * all mappings are revoked on runtime device suspend.
 *
 *  * there are only 8, 16 or 32 fence registers to share between all users
 *    (older machines require fence register for display and blitter access
 *    as well). Contention of the fence registers will cause the previous users
 *    to be unmapped and any new access will generate new page faults.
 *
 *  * running out of memory while servicing a fault may generate a SIGBUS,
 *    rather than the expected SIGSEGV.
