 * synchronize_rcu_tasks() makes sure that no task is stuck in preempted
 * state (have scheduled out non-voluntarily) by making sure that all
 * tasks have either left the run queue or have gone into user space.
 * As idle tasks do not do either, they must not ever be preempted
 * (schedule out non-voluntarily).
 *
 * schedule_idle() is similar to schedule_preempt_disable() except that it
 * never enables preemption because it does not call sched_submit_work().
