 * This appends the listed symbols to /proc/vmcore
 *
 * /proc/vmcore is used by various utilities, like crash and makedumpfile to
 * obtain access to symbols that are otherwise very difficult to locate.  These
 * symbols are specifically used so that utilities can access and extract the
 * dmesg log from a vmcore file after a crash.
