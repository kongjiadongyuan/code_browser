 * acpi_dev_get_dma_resources - Get current DMA resources of a device.
 * @adev: ACPI device node to get the resources for.
 * @list: Head of the resultant list of resources (must be empty).
 *
 * Evaluate the _DMA method for the given device node and process its
 * output.
 *
 * The resultant struct resource objects are put on the list pointed to
 * by @list, that must be empty initially, as members of struct
 * resource_entry objects.  Callers of this routine should use
 * %acpi_dev_free_resource_list() to free that list.
 *
 * The number of resources in the output list is returned on success,
 * an error code reflecting the error condition is returned otherwise.
