 * led_trigger_rename_static - rename a trigger
 * @name: the new trigger name
 * @trig: the LED trigger to rename
 *
 * Change a LED trigger name by copying the string passed in
 * name into current trigger name, which MUST be large
 * enough for the new string.
 *
 * Note that name must NOT point to the same string used
 * during LED registration, as that could lead to races.
 *
 * This is meant to be used on triggers with statically
 * allocated name.
