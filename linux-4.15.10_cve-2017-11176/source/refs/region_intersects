 * region_intersects() - determine intersection of region with known resources
 * @start: region start address
 * @size: size of region
 * @flags: flags of resource (in iomem_resource)
 * @desc: descriptor of resource (in iomem_resource) or IORES_DESC_NONE
 *
 * Check if the specified region partially overlaps or fully eclipses a
 * resource identified by @flags and @desc (optional with IORES_DESC_NONE).
 * Return REGION_DISJOINT if the region does not overlap @flags/@desc,
 * return REGION_MIXED if the region overlaps @flags/@desc and another
 * resource, and return REGION_INTERSECTS if the region overlaps @flags/@desc
 * and no other defined resource. Note that REGION_INTERSECTS is also
 * returned in the case when the specified region overlaps RAM and undefined
 * memory holes.
 *
 * region_intersect() is used by memory remapping functions to ensure
 * the user is not remapping RAM and is a vast speed up over walking
 * through the resource table page by page.
