 * @dev: network device

 * @gfp: allocation flags
 *
 * This function may be called with the driver passing either the BSSID of the
 * new AP or passing the bss entry to avoid a race in timeout of the bss entry.
 * It should be called by the underlying driver whenever it roamed from one AP
 * to another while connected. Drivers which have roaming implemented in
 * firmware should pass the bss entry to avoid a race in bss entry timeout where
 * the bss entry of the new AP is seen in the driver, but gets timed out by the
 * time it is accessed in __cfg80211_roamed() due to delay in scheduling
 * rdev-&gt;event_work. In case of any failures, the reference is released
 * either in cfg80211_roamed() or in __cfg80211_romed(), Otherwise, it will be
 * released while diconneting from the current bss.
