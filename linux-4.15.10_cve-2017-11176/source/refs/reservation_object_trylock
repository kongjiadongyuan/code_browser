 * @obj: the reservation object
 *
 * Tries to lock the reservation object for exclusive access and modification.
 * Note, that the lock is only against other writers, readers will run
 * concurrently with a writer under RCU. The seqlock is used to notify readers
 * if they overlap with a writer.
 *
 * Also note that since no context is provided, no deadlock protection is
 * possible.
 *
 * Returns true if the lock was acquired, false otherwise.
