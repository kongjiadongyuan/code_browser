 * If the loading application (or library) and the loaded ENGINE library
 * share the same static data (eg. they&apos;re both dynamically linked to the
 * same libcrypto.so) we need a way to avoid trying to set system callbacks -
 * this would fail, and for the same reason that it&apos;s unnecessary to try. If
 * the loaded ENGINE has (or gets from through the loader) its own copy of
 * the libcrypto static data, we will need to set the callbacks. The easiest
 * way to detect this is to have a function that returns a pointer to some
 * static data and let the loading application and loaded ENGINE compare
 * their respective values.
