 * i915_gem_object_do_bit_17_swizzle - fixup bit 17 swizzling
 * @obj: i915 GEM buffer object
 * @pages: the scattergather list of physical pages
 *
 * This function fixes up the swizzling in case any page frame number for this
 * object has changed in bit 17 since that state has been saved with
 * i915_gem_object_save_bit_17_swizzle().
 *
 * This is called when pinning backing storage again, since the kernel is free
 * to move unpinned backing storage around (either by directly moving pages or
 * by swapping them out and back in again).
