 * i915_gem_shrink_all - Shrink buffer object caches completely
 * @dev_priv: i915 device
 *
 * This is a simple wraper around i915_gem_shrink() to aggressively shrink all
 * caches completely. It also first waits for and retires all outstanding
 * requests to also be able to release backing storage for active objects.
 *
 * This should only be used in code to intentionally quiescent the gpu or as a
 * last-ditch effort when memory seems to have run out.
 *
 * Returns:
 * The number of pages of backing storage actually released.
