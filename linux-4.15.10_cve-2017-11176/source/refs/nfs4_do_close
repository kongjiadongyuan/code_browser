 * This means that we can&apos;t safely call nfsv4 close on a file until 
 * the inode is cleared. This in turn means that we are not good
 * NFSv4 citizens - we do not indicate to the server to update the file&apos;s 
 * share state even when we are done with one of the three share 
 * stateid&apos;s in the inode.
