 * enum nl80211_nan_func_attributes - NAN function attributes
 * @__NL80211_NAN_FUNC_INVALID: invalid
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_TYPE: &amp;enum nl80211_nan_function_type (u8).
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_SERVICE_ID: 6 bytes of the service ID hash as
 *	specified in NAN spec. This is a binary attribute.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_PUBLISH_TYPE: relevant if the function&apos;s type is
 *	publish. Defines the transmission type for the publish Service Discovery
 *	Frame, see &amp;enum nl80211_nan_publish_type. Its type is u8.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_PUBLISH_BCAST: relevant if the function is a solicited
 *	publish. Should the solicited publish Service Discovery Frame be sent to
 *	the NAN Broadcast address. This is a flag.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_SUBSCRIBE_ACTIVE: relevant if the function&apos;s type is
 *	subscribe. Is the subscribe active. This is a flag.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_FOLLOW_UP_ID: relevant if the function&apos;s type is follow up.
 *	The instance ID for the follow up Service Discovery Frame. This is u8.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_FOLLOW_UP_REQ_ID: relevant if the function&apos;s type
 *	is follow up. This is a u8.
 *	The requestor instance ID for the follow up Service Discovery Frame.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_FOLLOW_UP_DEST: the MAC address of the recipient of the
 *	follow up Service Discovery Frame. This is a binary attribute.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_CLOSE_RANGE: is this function limited for devices in a
 *	close range. The range itself (RSSI) is defined by the device.
 *	This is a flag.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_TTL: strictly positive number of DWs this function should
 *	stay active. If not present infinite TTL is assumed. This is a u32.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_SERVICE_INFO: array of bytes describing the service
 *	specific info. This is a binary attribute.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_SRF: Service Receive Filter. This is a nested attribute.
 *	See &amp;enum nl80211_nan_srf_attributes.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_RX_MATCH_FILTER: Receive Matching filter. This is a nested
 *	attribute. It is a list of binary values.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_TX_MATCH_FILTER: Transmit Matching filter. This is a
 *	nested attribute. It is a list of binary values.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_INSTANCE_ID: The instance ID of the function.
 *	Its type is u8 and it cannot be 0.
 * @NL80211_NAN_FUNC_TERM_REASON: NAN function termination reason.
 *	See &amp;enum nl80211_nan_func_term_reason.
 *
 * @NUM_NL80211_NAN_FUNC_ATTR: internal
