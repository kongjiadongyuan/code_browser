 * An adaptive-ticks CPU can potentially execute in kernel mode for an
 * arbitrarily long period of time with the scheduling-clock tick turned
 * off.  RCU will be paying attention to this CPU because it is in the
 * kernel, but the CPU cannot be guaranteed to be executing the RCU state
 * machine because the scheduling-clock tick has been disabled.  Therefore,
 * if an adaptive-ticks CPU is failing to respond to the current grace
 * period and has not be idle from an RCU perspective, kick it.
