 * Start a pte protection read-modify-write transaction, which
 * protects against asynchronous hardware modifications to the pte.
 * The intention is not to prevent the hardware from making pte
 * updates, but to prevent any updates it may make from being lost.
 *
 * This does not protect against other software modifications of the
 * pte; the appropriate pte lock must be held over the transation.
 *
 * Note that this interface is intended to be batchable, meaning that
 * ptep_modify_prot_commit may not actually update the pte, but merely
 * queue the update to be done at some later time.  The update must be
 * actually committed before the pte lock is released, however.
