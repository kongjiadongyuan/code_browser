 * snd_pcm_trigger_done - Mark the master substream
 * @substream: the pcm substream instance
 * @master: the linked master substream
 *
 * When multiple substreams of the same card are linked and the hardware
 * supports the single-shot operation, the driver calls this in the loop
 * in snd_pcm_group_for_each_entry() for marking the substream as &quot;done&quot;.
 * Then most of trigger operations are performed only to the given master
 * substream.
 *
 * The trigger_master mark is cleared at timestamp updates at the end
 * of trigger operations.
