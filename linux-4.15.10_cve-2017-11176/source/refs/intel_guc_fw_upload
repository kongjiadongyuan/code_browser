 * @guc: intel_guc structure
 *
 * Called during driver loading and also after a GPU reset.
 *
 * The main action required here it to load the GuC uCode into the device.
 * The firmware image should have already been fetched into memory by the
 * earlier call to intel_guc_init(), so here we need only check that
 * worked, and then transfer the image to the h/w.

 * Return:	non-zero code on error
