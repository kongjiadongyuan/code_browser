 * lowpan_header_decompress - replace 6LoWPAN header with IPv6 header
 *
 * This function replaces the IPHC 6LoWPAN header which should be pointed at
 * skb-&gt;data and skb_network_header, with the IPv6 header.
 * It would be nice that the caller have the necessary headroom of IPv6 header
 * and greatest Transport layer header, this would reduce the overhead for
 * reallocate headroom.
 *
 * @skb: the buffer which should be manipulate.
 * @dev: the lowpan net device pointer.
 * @daddr: destination lladdr of mac header which is used for compression
 *	methods.
 * @saddr: source lladdr of mac header which is used for compression
 *	methods.
