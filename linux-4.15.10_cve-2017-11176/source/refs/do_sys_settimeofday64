 * In case for some reason the CMOS clock has not already been running
 * in UTC, but in some local time: The first time we set the timezone,
 * we will warp the clock so that it is ticking UTC time instead of
 * local time. Presumably, if someone is setting the timezone then we
 * are running in an environment where the programs understand about
 * timezones. This should be done at boot time in the /etc/rc script,
 * as soon as possible, so that the clock can be set right. Otherwise,
 * various programs will get confused when the clock gets warped.
