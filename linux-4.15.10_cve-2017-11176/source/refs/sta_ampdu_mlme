 * struct sta_ampdu_mlme - STA aggregation information.
 *
 * @mtx: mutex to protect all TX data (except non-NULL assignments
 *	to tid_tx[idx], which are protected by the sta spinlock)
 *	tid_start_tx is also protected by sta-&gt;lock.
 * @tid_rx: aggregation info for Rx per TID -- RCU protected
 * @tid_rx_token: dialog tokens for valid aggregation sessions
 * @tid_rx_timer_expired: bitmap indicating on which TIDs the
 *	RX timer expired until the work for it runs
 * @tid_rx_stop_requested:  bitmap indicating which BA sessions per TID the
 *	driver requested to close until the work for it runs
 * @tid_rx_manage_offl: bitmap indicating which BA sessions were requested
 *	to be treated as started/stopped due to offloading
 * @agg_session_valid: bitmap indicating which TID has a rx BA session open on
 * @unexpected_agg: bitmap indicating which TID already sent a delBA due to
 *	unexpected aggregation related frames outside a session
 * @work: work struct for starting/stopping aggregation
 * @tid_tx: aggregation info for Tx per TID
 * @tid_start_tx: sessions where start was requested
 * @last_addba_req_time: timestamp of the last addBA request.
 * @addba_req_num: number of times addBA request has been sent.
 * @dialog_token_allocator: dialog token enumerator for each new session;
