 * ieee80211_resume_disconnect - disconnect from AP after resume
 *
 * @vif: &amp;struct ieee80211_vif pointer from the add_interface callback.
 *
 * Instructs mac80211 to disconnect from the AP after resume.
 * Drivers can use this after WoWLAN if they know that the
 * connection cannot be kept up, for example because keys were
 * used while the device was asleep but the replay counters or
 * similar cannot be retrieved from the device during resume.
 *
 * Note that due to implementation issues, if the driver uses
 * the reconfiguration functionality during resume the interface
 * will still be added as associated first during resume and then
 * disconnect normally later.
 *
 * This function can only be called from the resume callback and
 * the driver must not be holding any of its own locks while it
 * calls this function, or at least not any locks it needs in the
 * key configuration paths (if it supports HW crypto).
