 *	skb_checksum_complete - Calculate checksum of an entire packet
 *	@skb: packet to process
 *
 *	This function calculates the checksum over the entire packet plus
 *	the value of skb-&gt;csum.  The latter can be used to supply the
 *	checksum of a pseudo header as used by TCP/UDP.  It returns the
 *	checksum.
 *
 *	For protocols that contain complete checksums such as ICMP/TCP/UDP,
 *	this function can be used to verify that checksum on received
 *	packets.  In that case the function should return zero if the
 *	checksum is correct.  In particular, this function will return zero
 *	if skb-&gt;ip_summed is CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY which indicates that the
 *	hardware has already verified the correctness of the checksum.
