 * phys_addr is either 0 (if this is the CEC root device)
 * or a valid physical address obtained from the sink&apos;s EDID
 * as read by this CEC device (if this is a source device)
 * or a physical address obtained and modified from a sink
 * EDID and used for a sink CEC device.
 * If nothing is connected, then phys_addr is 0xffff.

 * The CEC_ADAP_S_PHYS_ADDR ioctl may not be available if that is handled
