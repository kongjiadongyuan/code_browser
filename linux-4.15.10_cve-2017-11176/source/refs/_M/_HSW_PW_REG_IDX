 * Each power well control register contains up to 16 (request, status) HW
 * flag tuples. The register index and HW flag shift is determined by the
 * power well ID (see i915_power_well_id). There are 4 possible sources of
 * power well requests each source having its own set of control registers:
 * BIOS, DRIVER, KVMR, DEBUG.
