 * wait_event_lock_irq - sleep until a condition gets true. The
 *			 condition is checked under the lock. This
 *			 is expected to be called with the lock
 *			 taken.
 * @wq_head: the waitqueue to wait on
 * @condition: a C expression for the event to wait for
 * @lock: a locked spinlock_t, which will be released before schedule()
 *	  and reacquired afterwards.
 *
 * The process is put to sleep (TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE) until the
 * @condition evaluates to true. The @condition is checked each time
 * the waitqueue @wq_head is woken up.
 *
 * wake_up() has to be called after changing any variable that could
 * change the result of the wait condition.
 *
 * This is supposed to be called while holding the lock. The lock is
 * dropped before going to sleep and is reacquired afterwards.
