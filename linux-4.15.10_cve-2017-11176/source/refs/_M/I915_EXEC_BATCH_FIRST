 * Traditionally the execbuf ioctl has only considered the final element in
 * the execobject[] to be the executable batch. Often though, the client
 * will known the batch object prior to construction and being able to place
 * it into the execobject[] array first can simplify the relocation tracking.
 * Setting I915_EXEC_BATCH_FIRST tells execbuf to use element 0 of the
 * execobject[] as the * batch instead (the default is to use the last
 * element).
