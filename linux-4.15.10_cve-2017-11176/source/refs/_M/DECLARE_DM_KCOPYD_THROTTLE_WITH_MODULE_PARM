 * kcopyd clients that want to support throttling must pass an initialised
 * dm_kcopyd_throttle struct into dm_kcopyd_client_create().
 * Two or more clients may share the same instance of this struct between
 * them if they wish to be throttled as a group.
 *
 * This macro also creates a corresponding module parameter to configure
