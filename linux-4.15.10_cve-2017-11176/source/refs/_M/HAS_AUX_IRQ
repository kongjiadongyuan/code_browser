 * dp aux and gmbus irq on gen4 seems to be able to generate legacy interrupts
 * even when in MSI mode. This results in spurious interrupt warnings if the
 * legacy irq no. is shared with another device. The kernel then disables that
 * interrupt source and so prevents the other device from working properly.
 *
 * Since we don&apos;t enable MSI anymore on gen4, we can always use GMBUS/AUX
 * interrupts.
