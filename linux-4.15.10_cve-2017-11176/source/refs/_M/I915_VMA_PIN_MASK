	 * How many users have pinned this object in GTT space. The following
	 * users can each hold at most one reference: pwrite/pread, execbuffer
	 * (objects are not allowed multiple times for the same batchbuffer),
	 * and the framebuffer code. When switching/pageflipping, the
	 * framebuffer code has at most two buffers pinned per crtc.
	 *
	 * In the worst case this is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2*2 = 7. That would fit into 3
	 * bits with absolutely no headroom. So use 4 bits.
