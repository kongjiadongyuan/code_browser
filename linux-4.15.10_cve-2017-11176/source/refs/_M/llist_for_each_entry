 * llist_for_each_entry - iterate over some deleted entries of lock-less list of given type
 * @pos:	the type * to use as a loop cursor.
 * @node:	the fist entry of deleted list entries.
 * @member:	the name of the llist_node with the struct.
 *
 * In general, some entries of the lock-less list can be traversed
 * safely only after being removed from list, so start with an entry
 * instead of list head.
 *
 * If being used on entries deleted from lock-less list directly, the
 * traverse order is from the newest to the oldest added entry.  If
 * you want to traverse from the oldest to the newest, you must
 * reverse the order by yourself before traversing.
