 * Page mobility and placement hints
 *
 * These flags provide hints about how mobile the page is. Pages with similar
 * mobility are placed within the same pageblocks to minimise problems due
 * to external fragmentation.
 *
 * __GFP_MOVABLE (also a zone modifier) indicates that the page can be
 *   moved by page migration during memory compaction or can be reclaimed.
 *
 * __GFP_RECLAIMABLE is used for slab allocations that specify
 *   SLAB_RECLAIM_ACCOUNT and whose pages can be freed via shrinkers.
 *
 * __GFP_WRITE indicates the caller intends to dirty the page. Where possible,
 *   these pages will be spread between local zones to avoid all the dirty
 *   pages being in one zone (fair zone allocation policy).
 *
 * __GFP_HARDWALL enforces the cpuset memory allocation policy.
 *
 * __GFP_THISNODE forces the allocation to be satisified from the requested
 *   node with no fallbacks or placement policy enforcements.
 *
 * __GFP_ACCOUNT causes the allocation to be accounted to kmemcg.
