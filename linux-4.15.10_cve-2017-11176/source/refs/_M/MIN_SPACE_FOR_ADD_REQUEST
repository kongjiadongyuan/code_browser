 * Arbitrary size for largest possible &apos;add request&apos; sequence. The code paths
 * are complex and variable. Empirical measurement shows that the worst case
 * is BDW at 192 bytes (6 + 6 + 36 dwords), then ILK at 136 bytes. However,
 * we need to allocate double the largest single packet within that emission
 * to account for tail wraparound (so 6 + 6 + 72 dwords for BDW).
