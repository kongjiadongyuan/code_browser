 * Default discarded sections.

 * Some archs want to discard exit text/data at runtime rather than
 * link time due to cross-section references such as alt instructions,
 * bug table, eh_frame, etc.  DISCARDS must be the last of output
 * section definitions so that such archs put those in earlier section
 * definitions.
