	 * @read: Copy buffered metrics as records to userspace
	 * **buf**: the userspace, destination buffer
	 * **count**: the number of bytes to copy, requested by userspace
	 * **offset**: zero at the start of the read, updated as the read
	 * proceeds, it represents how many bytes have been copied so far and
	 * the buffer offset for copying the next record.
	 *
	 * Copy as many buffered i915 perf samples and records for this stream
	 * to userspace as will fit in the given buffer.
	 *
	 * Only write complete records; returning -%ENOSPC if there isn&apos;t room
	 * for a complete record.
	 *
	 * Return any error condition that results in a short read such as
	 * -%ENOSPC or -%EFAULT, even though these may be squashed before
	 * returning to userspace.
