 * struct notification - container for seccomp userspace notifications. Since
 * most seccomp filters will not have notification listeners attached and this
 * structure is fairly large, we store the notification-specific stuff in a
 * separate structure.
 *
 * @request: A semaphore that users of this notification can wait on for
 *           changes. Actual reads and writes are still controlled with
 *           filter-&gt;notify_lock.
 * @next_id: The id of the next request.
 * @notifications: A list of struct seccomp_knotif elements.
 * @wqh: A wait queue for poll.
