 * For a TCP Fast Open listener -
 *	lock - protects the access to all the reqsk, which is co-owned by
 *		the listener and the child socket.
 *	qlen - pending TFO requests (still in TCP_SYN_RECV).
 *	max_qlen - max TFO reqs allowed before TFO is disabled.
 *
 *	XXX (TFO) - ideally these fields can be made as part of &quot;listen_sock&quot;
 *	structure above. But there is some implementation difficulty due to
 *	listen_sock being part of request_sock_queue hence will be freed when
 *	a listener is stopped. But TFO related fields may continue to be
 *	accessed even after a listener is closed, until its sk_refcnt drops
 *	to 0 implying no more outstanding TFO reqs. One solution is to keep
 *	listen_opt around until	sk_refcnt drops to 0. But there is some other
 *	complexity that needs to be resolved. E.g., a listener can be disabled
 *	temporarily through shutdown()-&gt;tcp_disconnect(), and re-enabled later.
