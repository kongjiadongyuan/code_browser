 * xas_prev() - Move iterator to previous index.
 * @xas: XArray operation state.
 *
 * If the @xas was in an error state, it will remain in an error state
 * and this function will return %NULL.  If the @xas has never been walked,
 * it will have the effect of calling xas_load().  Otherwise one will be
 * subtracted from the index and the state will be walked to the correct
 * location in the array for the next operation.
 *
 * If the iterator was referencing index 0, this function wraps
 * around to %ULONG_MAX.
 *
 * Return: The entry at the new index.  This may be %NULL or an internal
 * entry.
