 * enum ieee80211_filter_flags - hardware filter flags
 *
 * These flags determine what the filter in hardware should be
 * programmed to let through and what should not be passed to the
 * stack. It is always safe to pass more frames than requested,
 * but this has negative impact on power consumption.
 *
 * @FIF_ALLMULTI: pass all multicast frames, this is used if requested
 *	by the user or if the hardware is not capable of filtering by
 *	multicast address.
 *
 * @FIF_FCSFAIL: pass frames with failed FCS (but you need to set the
 *	%RX_FLAG_FAILED_FCS_CRC for them)
 *
 * @FIF_PLCPFAIL: pass frames with failed PLCP CRC (but you need to set
 *	the %RX_FLAG_FAILED_PLCP_CRC for them
 *
 * @FIF_BCN_PRBRESP_PROMISC: This flag is set during scanning to indicate
 *	to the hardware that it should not filter beacons or probe responses
 *	by BSSID. Filtering them can greatly reduce the amount of processing
 *	mac80211 needs to do and the amount of CPU wakeups, so you should
 *	honour this flag if possible.
 *
 * @FIF_CONTROL: pass control frames (except for PS Poll) addressed to this
 *	station
 *
 * @FIF_OTHER_BSS: pass frames destined to other BSSes
 *
 * @FIF_PSPOLL: pass PS Poll frames
 *
 * @FIF_PROBE_REQ: pass probe request frames
