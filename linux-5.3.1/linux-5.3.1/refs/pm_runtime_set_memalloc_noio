 * pm_runtime_set_memalloc_noio - Set a device&apos;s memalloc_noio flag.
 * @dev: Device to handle.
 * @enable: True for setting the flag and False for clearing the flag.
 *
 * Set the flag for all devices in the path from the device to the
 * root device in the device tree if @enable is true, otherwise clear
 * the flag for devices in the path whose siblings don&apos;t set the flag.
 *
 * The function should only be called by block device, or network
 * device driver for solving the deadlock problem during runtime
 * resume/suspend:
 *
 *     If memory allocation with GFP_KERNEL is called inside runtime
 *     resume/suspend callback of any one of its ancestors(or the
 *     block device itself), the deadlock may be triggered inside the
 *     memory allocation since it might not complete until the block
 *     device becomes active and the involed page I/O finishes. The
 *     situation is pointed out first by Alan Stern. Network device
 *     are involved in iSCSI kind of situation.
 *
 * The lock of dev_hotplug_mutex is held in the function for handling
 * hotplug race because pm_runtime_set_memalloc_noio() may be called
 * in async probe().
 *
 * The function should be called between device_add() and device_del()
 * on the affected device(block/network device).
