 * stop_one_cpu - stop a cpu
 * @cpu: cpu to stop
 * @fn: function to execute
 * @arg: argument to @fn
 *
 * Execute @fn(@arg) on @cpu.  @fn is run in a process context with
 * the highest priority preempting any task on the cpu and
 * monopolizing it.  This function returns after the execution is
 * complete.
 *
 * This function doesn&apos;t guarantee @cpu stays online till @fn
 * completes.  If @cpu goes down in the middle, execution may happen
 * partially or fully on different cpus.  @fn should either be ready
 * for that or the caller should ensure that @cpu stays online until
 * this function completes.
 *
 * CONTEXT:
 * Might sleep.
 *
 * RETURNS:
 * -ENOENT if @fn(@arg) was not executed because @cpu was offline;
 * otherwise, the return value of @fn.
