 * d_alloc_pseudo - allocate a dentry (for lookup-less filesystems)
 * @sb: the superblock
 * @name: qstr of the name
 *
 * For a filesystem that just pins its dentries in memory and never
 * performs lookups at all, return an unhashed IS_ROOT dentry.
 * This is used for pipes, sockets et.al. - the stuff that should
 * never be anyone&apos;s children or parents.  Unlike all other
 * dentries, these will not have RCU delay between dropping the
 * last reference and freeing them.
 *
 * The only user is alloc_file_pseudo() and that&apos;s what should
 * be considered a public interface.  Don&apos;t use directly.
