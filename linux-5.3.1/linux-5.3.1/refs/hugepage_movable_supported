 * Movability check is different as compared to migration check.
 * It determines whether or not a huge page should be placed on
 * movable zone or not. Movability of any huge page should be
 * required only if huge page size is supported for migration.
 * There wont be any reason for the huge page to be movable if
 * it is not migratable to start with. Also the size of the huge
 * page should be large enough to be placed under a movable zone
 * and still feasible enough to be migratable. Just the presence
 * in movable zone does not make the migration feasible.
 *
 * So even though large huge page sizes like the gigantic ones
 * are migratable they should not be movable because its not
 * feasible to migrate them from movable zone.
