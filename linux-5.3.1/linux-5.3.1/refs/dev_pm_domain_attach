 * dev_pm_domain_attach - Attach a device to its PM domain.
 * @dev: Device to attach.
 * @power_on: Used to indicate whether we should power on the device.
 *
 * The @dev may only be attached to a single PM domain. By iterating through
 * the available alternatives we try to find a valid PM domain for the device.
 * As attachment succeeds, the -&gt;detach() callback in the struct dev_pm_domain
 * should be assigned by the corresponding attach function.
 *
 * This function should typically be invoked from subsystem level code during
 * the probe phase. Especially for those that holds devices which requires
 * power management through PM domains.
 *
 * Callers must ensure proper synchronization of this function with power
 * management callbacks.
 *
 * Returns 0 on successfully attached PM domain, or when it is found that the
 * device doesn&apos;t need a PM domain, else a negative error code.
