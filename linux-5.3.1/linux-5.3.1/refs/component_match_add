 * component_match_add - add a component match entry
 * @master: device with the aggregate driver
 * @matchptr: pointer to the list of component matches
 * @compare: compare function to match against all components
 * @compare_data: opaque pointer passed to the @compare function
 *
 * Adds a new component match to the list stored in @matchptr, which the @master
 * aggregate driver needs to function. The list of component matches pointed to
 * by @matchptr must be initialized to NULL before adding the first match. This
 * only matches against components added with component_add().
 *
 * The allocated match list in @matchptr is automatically released using devm
 * actions.
