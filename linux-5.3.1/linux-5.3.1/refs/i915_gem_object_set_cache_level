 * Changes the cache-level of an object across all VMA.
 * @obj: object to act on
 * @cache_level: new cache level to set for the object
 *
 * After this function returns, the object will be in the new cache-level
 * across all GTT and the contents of the backing storage will be coherent,
 * with respect to the new cache-level. In order to keep the backing storage
 * coherent for all users, we only allow a single cache level to be set
 * globally on the object and prevent it from being changed whilst the
 * hardware is reading from the object. That is if the object is currently
 * on the scanout it will be set to uncached (or equivalent display
 * cache coherency) and all non-MOCS GPU access will also be uncached so
 * that all direct access to the scanout remains coherent.
