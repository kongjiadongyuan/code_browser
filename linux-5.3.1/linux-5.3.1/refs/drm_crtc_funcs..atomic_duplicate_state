	 * @atomic_duplicate_state:
	 *
	 * Duplicate the current atomic state for this CRTC and return it.
	 * The core and helpers guarantee that any atomic state duplicated with
	 * this hook and still owned by the caller (i.e. not transferred to the
	 * driver by calling &amp;drm_mode_config_funcs.atomic_commit) will be
	 * cleaned up by calling the @atomic_destroy_state hook in this
	 * structure.
	 *
	 * This callback is mandatory for atomic drivers.
	 *
	 * Atomic drivers which don&apos;t subclass &amp;struct drm_crtc_state should use
	 * drm_atomic_helper_crtc_duplicate_state(). Drivers that subclass the
	 * state structure to extend it with driver-private state should use
	 * __drm_atomic_helper_crtc_duplicate_state() to make sure shared state is
	 * duplicated in a consistent fashion across drivers.
	 *
	 * It is an error to call this hook before &amp;drm_crtc.state has been
	 * initialized correctly.
	 *
	 * NOTE:
	 *
	 * If the duplicate state references refcounted resources this hook must
	 * acquire a reference for each of them. The driver must release these
	 * references again in @atomic_destroy_state.
	 *
	 * RETURNS:
	 *
	 * Duplicated atomic state or NULL when the allocation failed.
