 * pci_get_class - begin or continue searching for a PCI device by class
 * @class: search for a PCI device with this class designation
 * @from: Previous PCI device found in search, or %NULL for new search.
 *
 * Iterates through the list of known PCI devices.  If a PCI device is
 * found with a matching @class, the reference count to the device is
 * incremented and a pointer to its device structure is returned.
 * Otherwise, %NULL is returned.
 * A new search is initiated by passing %NULL as the @from argument.
 * Otherwise if @from is not %NULL, searches continue from next device
 * on the global list.  The reference count for @from is always decremented
 * if it is not %NULL.
