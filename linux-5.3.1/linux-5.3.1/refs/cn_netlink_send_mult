 * @group:	destination group.
 * 		If @portid and @group is zero, then appropriate group will

 * Sends mult (multiple) cn_msg at a time.
 *
 * msg-&gt;seq and msg-&gt;ack are used to determine message genealogy.
 * When someone sends message it puts there locally unique sequence
 * and random acknowledge numbers.  Sequence number may be copied into
 * nlmsghdr-&gt;nlmsg_seq too.
 *
 * Sequence number is incremented with each message to be sent.
 *
 * If we expect a reply to our message then the sequence number in
 * received message MUST be the same as in original message, and
 * acknowledge number MUST be the same + 1.
 *
 * If we receive a message and its sequence number is not equal to the
 * one we are expecting then it is a new message.
 *
 * If we receive a message and its sequence number is the same as one
 * we are expecting but it&apos;s acknowledgement number is not equal to
 * the acknowledgement number in the original message + 1, then it is
 * a new message.
 *
 * If msg-&gt;len != len, then additional cn_msg messages are expected following
 * the first msg.
 *
 * The message is sent to, the portid if given, the group if given, both if
 * both, or if both are zero then the group is looked up and sent there.
