 * kthread_cancel_work_sync - cancel a kthread work and wait for it to finish
 * @work: the kthread work to cancel
 *
 * Cancel @work and wait for its execution to finish.  This function
 * can be used even if the work re-queues itself. On return from this
 * function, @work is guaranteed to be not pending or executing on any CPU.
 *
 * kthread_cancel_work_sync(&amp;delayed_work-&gt;work) must not be used for
 * delayed_work&apos;s. Use kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync() instead.
 *
 * The caller must ensure that the worker on which @work was last
 * queued can&apos;t be destroyed before this function returns.
 *
 * Return: %true if @work was pending, %false otherwise.
