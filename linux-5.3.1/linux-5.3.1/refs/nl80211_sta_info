 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_TX_BITRATE: current unicast tx rate, nested attribute
 * 	containing info as possible, see &amp;enum nl80211_rate_info
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_RX_PACKETS: total received packet (MSDUs and MMPDUs)
 *	(u32, from this station)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_TX_PACKETS: total transmitted packets (MSDUs and MMPDUs)
 *	(u32, to this station)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_TX_RETRIES: total retries (MPDUs) (u32, to this station)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_TX_FAILED: total failed packets (MPDUs)
 *	(u32, to this station)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_SIGNAL_AVG: signal strength average (u8, dBm)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_LLID: the station&apos;s mesh LLID
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_PLID: the station&apos;s mesh PLID
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_PLINK_STATE: peer link state for the station
 *	(see %enum nl80211_plink_state)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_RX_BITRATE: last unicast data frame rx rate, nested
 *	attribute, like NL80211_STA_INFO_TX_BITRATE.
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_BSS_PARAM: current station&apos;s view of BSS, nested attribute
 *     containing info as possible, see &amp;enum nl80211_sta_bss_param
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_CONNECTED_TIME: time since the station is last connected
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_STA_FLAGS: Contains a struct nl80211_sta_flag_update.
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_BEACON_LOSS: count of times beacon loss was detected (u32)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_T_OFFSET: timing offset with respect to this STA (s64)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_LOCAL_PM: local mesh STA link-specific power mode
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_PEER_PM: peer mesh STA link-specific power mode
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_NONPEER_PM: neighbor mesh STA power save mode towards
 *	non-peer STA
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_CHAIN_SIGNAL: per-chain signal strength of last PPDU
 *	Contains a nested array of signal strength attributes (u8, dBm)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_CHAIN_SIGNAL_AVG: per-chain signal strength average
 *	Same format as NL80211_STA_INFO_CHAIN_SIGNAL.
 * @NL80211_STA_EXPECTED_THROUGHPUT: expected throughput considering also the
 *	802.11 header (u32, kbps)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_RX_DROP_MISC: RX packets dropped for unspecified reasons
 *	(u64)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_BEACON_RX: number of beacons received from this peer (u64)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_BEACON_SIGNAL_AVG: signal strength average
 *	for beacons only (u8, dBm)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_TID_STATS: per-TID statistics (see &amp;enum nl80211_tid_stats)
 *	This is a nested attribute where each the inner attribute number is the
 *	TID+1 and the special TID 16 (i.e. value 17) is used for non-QoS frames;
 *	each one of those is again nested with &amp;enum nl80211_tid_stats
 *	attributes carrying the actual values.
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_RX_DURATION: aggregate PPDU duration for all frames
 *	received from the station (u64, usec)

 *	(u32, from this station)
 * @NL80211_STA_INFO_FCS_ERROR_COUNT: total number of packets (MPDUs) received
 *	with an FCS error (u32, from this station). This count may not include
 *	some packets with an FCS error due to TA corruption. Hence this counter
 *	might not be fully accurate.
