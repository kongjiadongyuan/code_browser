 * latch_tree_ops - operators to define the tree order
 * @less: used for insertion; provides the (partial) order between two elements.
 * @comp: used for lookups; provides the order between the search key and an element.
 *
 * The operators are related like:
 *
 *	comp(a-&gt;key,b) &lt; 0  := less(a,b)
 *	comp(a-&gt;key,b) &gt; 0  := less(b,a)
 *	comp(a-&gt;key,b) == 0 := !less(a,b) &amp;&amp; !less(b,a)
 *
 * If these operators define a partial order on the elements we make no
 * guarantee on which of the elements matching the key is found. See
 * latch_tree_find().
