 * cfg80211_vendor_event_alloc_ucast - alloc unicast vendor-specific event skb
 * @wiphy: the wiphy
 * @wdev: the wireless device
 * @event_idx: index of the vendor event in the wiphy&apos;s vendor_events
 * @portid: port ID of the receiver
 * @approxlen: an upper bound of the length of the data that will
 *	be put into the skb
 * @gfp: allocation flags
 *
 * This function allocates and pre-fills an skb for an event to send to
 * a specific (userland) socket. This socket would previously have been
 * obtained by cfg80211_vendor_cmd_get_sender(), and the caller MUST take
 * care to register a netlink notifier to see when the socket closes.
 *
 * If wdev != NULL, both the ifindex and identifier of the specified
 * wireless device are added to the event message before the vendor data
 * attribute.
 *
 * When done filling the skb, call cfg80211_vendor_event() with the
 * skb to send the event.
 *
 * Return: An allocated and pre-filled skb. %NULL if any errors happen.
