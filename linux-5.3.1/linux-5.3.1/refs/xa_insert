 * xa_insert() - Store this entry in the XArray unless another entry is
 *			already present.
 * @xa: XArray.
 * @index: Index into array.
 * @entry: New entry.
 * @gfp: Memory allocation flags.
 *
 * Inserting a NULL entry will store a reserved entry (like xa_reserve())
 * if no entry is present.  Inserting will fail if a reserved entry is
 * present, even though loading from this index will return NULL.
 *
 * Context: Any context.  Takes and releases the xa_lock.  May sleep if
 * the @gfp flags permit.
 * Return: 0 if the store succeeded.  -EBUSY if another entry was present.
 * -ENOMEM if memory could not be allocated.
