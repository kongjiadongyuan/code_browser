 * fscache_disable_cookie - Disable a cookie
 * @cookie: The cookie representing the cache object
 * @aux_data: The updated auxiliary data for the cookie (may be NULL)
 * @invalidate: Invalidate the backing object
 *
 * Disable a cookie from accepting further alloc, read, write, invalidate,
 * update or acquire operations.  Outstanding operations can still be waited
 * upon and pages can still be uncached and the cookie relinquished.
 *
 * This will not return until all outstanding operations have completed.
 *
 * If @invalidate is set, then the backing object will be invalidated and
 * detached, otherwise it will just be detached.
 *
 * If @aux_data is set, then auxiliary data will be updated from that.
