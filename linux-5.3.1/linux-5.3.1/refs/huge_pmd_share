 * Search for a shareable pmd page for hugetlb. In any case calls pmd_alloc()
 * and returns the corresponding pte. While this is not necessary for the
 * !shared pmd case because we can allocate the pmd later as well, it makes the
 * code much cleaner. pmd allocation is essential for the shared case because
 * pud has to be populated inside the same i_mmap_rwsem section - otherwise
 * racing tasks could either miss the sharing (see huge_pte_offset) or select a
 * bad pmd for sharing.
