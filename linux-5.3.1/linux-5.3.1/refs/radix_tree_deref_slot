 * @slot: slot pointer, returned by radix_tree_lookup_slot
 *
 * For use with radix_tree_lookup_slot().  Caller must hold tree at least read
 * locked across slot lookup and dereference. Not required if write lock is
 * held (ie. items cannot be concurrently inserted).
 *
 * radix_tree_deref_retry must be used to confirm validity of the pointer if
 * only the read lock is held.

 * Return: entry stored in that slot.
