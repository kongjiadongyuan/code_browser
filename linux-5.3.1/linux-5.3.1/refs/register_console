 * The console driver calls this routine during kernel initialization
 * to register the console printing procedure with printk() and to
 * print any messages that were printed by the kernel before the
 * console driver was initialized.
 *
 * This can happen pretty early during the boot process (because of
 * early_printk) - sometimes before setup_arch() completes - be careful
 * of what kernel features are used - they may not be initialised yet.
 *
 * There are two types of consoles - bootconsoles (early_printk) and
 * &quot;real&quot; consoles (everything which is not a bootconsole) which are
 * handled differently.
 *  - Any number of bootconsoles can be registered at any time.
 *  - As soon as a &quot;real&quot; console is registered, all bootconsoles
 *    will be unregistered automatically.
 *  - Once a &quot;real&quot; console is registered, any attempt to register a
 *    bootconsoles will be rejected
