 * intel_set_memory_cxsr - Configure CxSR state
 * @dev_priv: i915 device
 * @enable: Allow vs. disallow CxSR
 *
 * Allow or disallow the system to enter a special CxSR
 * (C-state self refresh) state. What typically happens in CxSR mode
 * is that several display FIFOs may get combined into a single larger
 * FIFO for a particular plane (so called max FIFO mode) to allow the
 * system to defer memory fetches longer, and the memory will enter
 * self refresh.
 *
 * Note that enabling CxSR does not guarantee that the system enter
 * this special mode, nor does it guarantee that the system stays
 * in that mode once entered. So this just allows/disallows the system
 * to autonomously utilize the CxSR mode. Other factors such as core
 * C-states will affect when/if the system actually enters/exits the
 * CxSR mode.
 *
 * Note that on VLV/CHV this actually only controls the max FIFO mode,
 * and the system is free to enter/exit memory self refresh at any time
 * even when the use of CxSR has been disallowed.
 *
 * While the system is actually in the CxSR/max FIFO mode, some plane
 * control registers will not get latched on vblank. Thus in order to
 * guarantee the system will respond to changes in the plane registers
 * we must always disallow CxSR prior to making changes to those registers.
 * Unfortunately the system will re-evaluate the CxSR conditions at
 * frame start which happens after vblank start (which is when the plane
 * registers would get latched), so we can&apos;t proceed with the plane update
 * during the same frame where we disallowed CxSR.
 *
 * Certain platforms also have a deeper HPLL SR mode. Fortunately the
 * HPLL SR mode depends on CxSR itself, so we don&apos;t have to hand hold
 * the hardware w.r.t. HPLL SR when writing to plane registers.
 * Disallowing just CxSR is sufficient.
