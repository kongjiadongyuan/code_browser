 * event_triggers_call - Call triggers associated with a trace event
 * @file: The trace_event_file associated with the event
 * @rec: The trace entry for the event, NULL for unconditional invocation
 *
 * For each trigger associated with an event, invoke the trigger
 * function registered with the associated trigger command.  If rec is
 * non-NULL, it means that the trigger requires further processing and
 * shouldn&apos;t be unconditionally invoked.  If rec is non-NULL and the
 * trigger has a filter associated with it, rec will checked against
 * the filter and if the record matches the trigger will be invoked.
 * If the trigger is a &apos;post_trigger&apos;, meaning it shouldn&apos;t be invoked
 * in any case until the current event is written, the trigger
 * function isn&apos;t invoked but the bit associated with the deferred
 * trigger is set in the return value.
 *
 * Returns an enum event_trigger_type value containing a set bit for
 * any trigger that should be deferred, ETT_NONE if nothing to defer.
 *
 * Called from tracepoint handlers (with rcu_read_lock_sched() held).
 *
 * Return: an enum event_trigger_type value containing a set bit for
 * any trigger that should be deferred, ETT_NONE if nothing to defer.
