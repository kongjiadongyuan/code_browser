 * dma_fence_wait - sleep until the fence gets signaled
 * @fence: the fence to wait on
 * @intr: if true, do an interruptible wait
 *
 * This function will return -ERESTARTSYS if interrupted by a signal,
 * or 0 if the fence was signaled. Other error values may be
 * returned on custom implementations.
 *
 * Performs a synchronous wait on this fence. It is assumed the caller
 * directly or indirectly holds a reference to the fence, otherwise the
 * fence might be freed before return, resulting in undefined behavior.
 *
 * See also dma_fence_wait_timeout() and dma_fence_wait_any_timeout().
