 * enum nl80211_bss - netlink attributes for a BSS
 *
 * @__NL80211_BSS_INVALID: invalid
 * @NL80211_BSS_BSSID: BSSID of the BSS (6 octets)
 * @NL80211_BSS_FREQUENCY: frequency in MHz (u32)
 * @NL80211_BSS_TSF: TSF of the received probe response/beacon (u64)
 *	(if @NL80211_BSS_PRESP_DATA is present then this is known to be
 *	from a probe response, otherwise it may be from the same beacon
 *	that the NL80211_BSS_BEACON_TSF will be from)
 * @NL80211_BSS_BEACON_INTERVAL: beacon interval of the (I)BSS (u16)
 * @NL80211_BSS_CAPABILITY: capability field (CPU order, u16)
 * @NL80211_BSS_INFORMATION_ELEMENTS: binary attribute containing the
 *	raw information elements from the probe response/beacon (bin);
 *	if the %NL80211_BSS_BEACON_IES attribute is present and the data is
 *	different then the IEs here are from a Probe Response frame; otherwise
 *	they are from a Beacon frame.
 *	However, if the driver does not indicate the source of the IEs, these
 *	IEs may be from either frame subtype.
 *	If present, the @NL80211_BSS_PRESP_DATA attribute indicates that the
 *	data here is known to be from a probe response, without any heuristics.
 * @NL80211_BSS_SIGNAL_MBM: signal strength of probe response/beacon
 *	in mBm (100 * dBm) (s32)
 * @NL80211_BSS_SIGNAL_UNSPEC: signal strength of the probe response/beacon
 *	in unspecified units, scaled to 0..100 (u8)
 * @NL80211_BSS_STATUS: status, if this BSS is &quot;used&quot;
 * @NL80211_BSS_SEEN_MS_AGO: age of this BSS entry in ms
 * @NL80211_BSS_BEACON_IES: binary attribute containing the raw information
 *	elements from a Beacon frame (bin); not present if no Beacon frame has
 *	yet been received
 * @NL80211_BSS_CHAN_WIDTH: channel width of the control channel
 *	(u32, enum nl80211_bss_scan_width)
 * @NL80211_BSS_BEACON_TSF: TSF of the last received beacon (u64)
 *	(not present if no beacon frame has been received yet)
 * @NL80211_BSS_PRESP_DATA: the data in @NL80211_BSS_INFORMATION_ELEMENTS and
 *	@NL80211_BSS_TSF is known to be from a probe response (flag attribute)
 * @NL80211_BSS_LAST_SEEN_BOOTTIME: CLOCK_BOOTTIME timestamp when this entry
 *	was last updated by a received frame. The value is expected to be
 *	accurate to about 10ms. (u64, nanoseconds)
 * @NL80211_BSS_PAD: attribute used for padding for 64-bit alignment
 * @NL80211_BSS_PARENT_TSF: the time at the start of reception of the first
 *	octet of the timestamp field of the last beacon/probe received for
 *	this BSS. The time is the TSF of the BSS specified by
 *	@NL80211_BSS_PARENT_BSSID. (u64).
 * @NL80211_BSS_PARENT_BSSID: the BSS according to which @NL80211_BSS_PARENT_TSF
 *	is set.
 * @NL80211_BSS_CHAIN_SIGNAL: per-chain signal strength of last BSS update.
 *	Contains a nested array of signal strength attributes (u8, dBm),
 *	using the nesting index as the antenna number.
 * @__NL80211_BSS_AFTER_LAST: internal
 * @NL80211_BSS_MAX: highest BSS attribute
