 * Sync everything. We start by waking flusher threads so that most of
 * writeback runs on all devices in parallel. Then we sync all inodes reliably
 * which effectively also waits for all flusher threads to finish doing
 * writeback. At this point all data is on disk so metadata should be stable
 * and we tell filesystems to sync their metadata via -&gt;sync_fs() calls.
 * Finally, we writeout all block devices because some filesystems (e.g. ext2)
 * just write metadata (such as inodes or bitmaps) to block device page cache
 * and do not sync it on their own in -&gt;sync_fs().
