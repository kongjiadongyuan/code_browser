 * enum nl80211_sched_scan_match_attr - scheduled scan match attributes
 * @__NL80211_SCHED_SCAN_MATCH_ATTR_INVALID: attribute number 0 is reserved
 * @NL80211_SCHED_SCAN_MATCH_ATTR_SSID: SSID to be used for matching,
 *	only report BSS with matching SSID.
 *	(This cannot be used together with BSSID.)
 * @NL80211_SCHED_SCAN_MATCH_ATTR_RSSI: RSSI threshold (in dBm) for reporting a
 *	BSS in scan results. Filtering is turned off if not specified. Note that
 *	if this attribute is in a match set of its own, then it is treated as
 *	the default value for all matchsets with an SSID, rather than being a
 *	matchset of its own without an RSSI filter. This is due to problems with
 *	how this API was implemented in the past. Also, due to the same problem,
 *	the only way to create a matchset with only an RSSI filter (with this
 *	attribute) is if there&apos;s only a single matchset with the RSSI attribute.
 * @NL80211_SCHED_SCAN_MATCH_ATTR_RELATIVE_RSSI: Flag indicating whether
 *	%NL80211_SCHED_SCAN_MATCH_ATTR_RSSI to be used as absolute RSSI or
 *	relative to current bss&apos;s RSSI.
 * @NL80211_SCHED_SCAN_MATCH_ATTR_RSSI_ADJUST: When present the RSSI level for
 *	BSS-es in the specified band is to be adjusted before doing
 *	RSSI-based BSS selection. The attribute value is a packed structure
 *	value as specified by &amp;struct nl80211_bss_select_rssi_adjust.
 * @NL80211_SCHED_SCAN_MATCH_ATTR_BSSID: BSSID to be used for matching
 *	(this cannot be used together with SSID).
 * @NL80211_SCHED_SCAN_MATCH_PER_BAND_RSSI: Nested attribute that carries the
 *	band specific minimum rssi thresholds for the bands defined in
 *	enum nl80211_band. The minimum rssi threshold value(s32) specific to a
 *	band shall be encapsulated in attribute with type value equals to one
 *	of the NL80211_BAND_* defined in enum nl80211_band. For example, the
 *	minimum rssi threshold value for 2.4GHZ band shall be encapsulated
 *	within an attribute of type NL80211_BAND_2GHZ. And one or more of such
 *	attributes will be nested within this attribute.
 * @NL80211_SCHED_SCAN_MATCH_ATTR_MAX: highest scheduled scan filter
 *	attribute number currently defined
 * @__NL80211_SCHED_SCAN_MATCH_ATTR_AFTER_LAST: internal use
