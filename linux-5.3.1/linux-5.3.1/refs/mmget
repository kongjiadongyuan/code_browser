 * mmget() - Pin the address space associated with a &amp;struct mm_struct.
 * @mm: The address space to pin.
 *
 * Make sure that the address space of the given &amp;struct mm_struct doesn&apos;t
 * go away. This does not protect against parts of the address space being
 * modified or freed, however.
 *
 * Never use this function to pin this address space for an
 * unbounded/indefinite amount of time.
 *
 * Use mmput() to release the reference acquired by mmget().
 *
 * See also &lt;Documentation/vm/active_mm.rst&gt; for an in-depth explanation
 * of &amp;mm_struct.mm_count vs &amp;mm_struct.mm_users.
