 * @device:	device pointer for which attributes to be created
 * @group:	Pointer to group which should be added when device
 *		is registered with sysfs.
 * rdma_set_device_sysfs_group() allows existing drivers to expose one
 * group per device to have sysfs attributes.
 *
 * NOTE: New drivers should not make use of this API; instead new device
 * parameter should be exposed via netlink command. This API and mechanism
 * exist only for existing drivers.
