 * _count and _version are what they seem like.  _max is actually just
 * accounting info for the firmware when creating the table; it should never

 * The maximum number of resource array entries that can be within the
 * table without reallocating the table, must not be zero.
 * Since there&apos;s no guidance about what that means in terms of memory layout,
 * it means nothing to us.
