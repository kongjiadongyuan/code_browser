 * enum drm_bus_flags - bus_flags info for &amp;drm_display_info
 *
 * This enum defines signal polarities and clock edge information for signals on
 * a bus as bitmask flags.
 *
 * The clock edge information is conveyed by two sets of symbols,
 * DRM_BUS_FLAGS_*_DRIVE_\* and DRM_BUS_FLAGS_*_SAMPLE_\*. When this enum is
 * used to describe a bus from the point of view of the transmitter, the
 * \*_DRIVE_\* flags should be used. When used from the point of view of the
 * receiver, the \*_SAMPLE_\* flags should be used. The \*_DRIVE_\* and
 * \*_SAMPLE_\* flags alias each other, with the \*_SAMPLE_POSEDGE and
 * \*_SAMPLE_NEGEDGE flags being equal to \*_DRIVE_NEGEDGE and \*_DRIVE_POSEDGE
 * respectively. This simplifies code as signals are usually sampled on the
 * opposite edge of the driving edge. Transmitters and receivers may however
 * need to take other signal timings into account to convert between driving
 * and sample edges.
 *
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_DE_LOW:		The Data Enable signal is active low
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_DE_HIGH:		The Data Enable signal is active high
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_PIXDATA_POSEDGE:	Legacy value, do not use
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_PIXDATA_NEGEDGE:	Legacy value, do not use
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_PIXDATA_DRIVE_POSEDGE:	Data is driven on the rising edge of
 *					the pixel clock
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_PIXDATA_DRIVE_NEGEDGE:	Data is driven on the falling edge of
 *					the pixel clock
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_PIXDATA_SAMPLE_POSEDGE: Data is sampled on the rising edge of
 *					the pixel clock
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_PIXDATA_SAMPLE_NEGEDGE: Data is sampled on the falling edge of
 *					the pixel clock
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_DATA_MSB_TO_LSB:	Data is transmitted MSB to LSB on the bus
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_DATA_LSB_TO_MSB:	Data is transmitted LSB to MSB on the bus
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_SYNC_POSEDGE:		Legacy value, do not use
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_SYNC_NEGEDGE:		Legacy value, do not use
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_SYNC_DRIVE_POSEDGE:	Sync signals are driven on the rising

 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_SYNC_SAMPLE_POSEDGE:	Sync signals are sampled on the rising
 *					edge of the pixel clock
 * @DRM_BUS_FLAG_SYNC_SAMPLE_NEGEDGE:	Sync signals are sampled on the falling
