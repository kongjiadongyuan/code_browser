 * radix_tree_deref_slot_protected - dereference a slot with tree lock held
 * @slot: slot pointer, returned by radix_tree_lookup_slot
 *
 * Similar to radix_tree_deref_slot.  The caller does not hold the RCU read
 * lock but it must hold the tree lock to prevent parallel updates.
 *
 * Return: entry stored in that slot.
