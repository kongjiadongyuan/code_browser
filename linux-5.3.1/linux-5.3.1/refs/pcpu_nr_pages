 * pcpu_nr_pages - calculate total number of populated backing pages
 *
 * This reflects the number of pages populated to back chunks.  Metadata is
 * excluded in the number exposed in meminfo as the number of backing pages
 * scales with the number of cpus and can quickly outweigh the memory used for
 * metadata.  It also keeps this calculation nice and simple.
 *
 * RETURNS:
 * Total number of populated backing pages in use by the allocator.
