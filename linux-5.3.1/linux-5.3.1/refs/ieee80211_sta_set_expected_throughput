 * ieee80211_sta_set_expected_throughput - set the expected tpt for a station
 *
 * Call this function to notify mac80211 about a change in expected throughput
 * to a station. A driver for a device that does rate control in firmware can
 * call this function when the expected throughput estimate towards a station
 * changes. The information is used to tune the CoDel AQM applied to traffic
 * going towards that station (which can otherwise be too aggressive and cause
 * slow stations to starve).
 *
 * @pubsta: the station to set throughput for.
 * @thr: the current expected throughput in kbps.
