 *
 * @lock:	the rt_mutex to be locked
 *
 * No locking. Caller has to do serializing itself
 *
 * Special API call for PI-futex support. This merrily cleans up the rtmutex
 * (debugging) state. Concurrent operations on this rt_mutex are not
 * possible because it belongs to the pi_state which is about to be freed
 * and it is not longer visible to other tasks.
