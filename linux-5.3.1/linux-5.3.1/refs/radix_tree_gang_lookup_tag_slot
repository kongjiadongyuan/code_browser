 *	@first_index:	start the lookup from this key
 *	@max_items:	place up to this many items at *results
 *	@tag:		the tag index (&lt; RADIX_TREE_MAX_TAGS)
 *
 *	Performs an index-ascending scan of the tree for present items which
 *	have the tag indexed by @tag set.  Places the slots at *@results and
 *	returns the number of slots which were placed at *@results.
