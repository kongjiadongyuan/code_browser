 * struct dev_pm_domain - power management domain representation.
 *
 * @ops: Power management operations associated with this domain.
 * @detach: Called when removing a device from the domain.
 * @activate: Called before executing probe routines for bus types and drivers.
 * @sync: Called after successful driver probe.
 * @dismiss: Called after unsuccessful driver probe and after driver removal.
 *
 * Power domains provide callbacks that are executed during system suspend,
 * hibernation, system resume and during runtime PM transitions instead of
 * subsystem-level and driver-level callbacks.
