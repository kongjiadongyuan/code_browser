 * enum dma_ctrl_flags - DMA flags to augment operation preparation,
 *  control completion, and communicate status.
 * @DMA_PREP_INTERRUPT - trigger an interrupt (callback) upon completion of
 *  this transaction
 * @DMA_CTRL_ACK - if clear, the descriptor cannot be reused until the client
 *  acknowledges receipt, i.e. has has a chance to establish any dependency
 *  chains
 * @DMA_PREP_PQ_DISABLE_P - prevent generation of P while generating Q
 * @DMA_PREP_PQ_DISABLE_Q - prevent generation of Q while generating P
 * @DMA_PREP_CONTINUE - indicate to a driver that it is reusing buffers as
 *  sources that were the result of a previous operation, in the case of a PQ
 *  operation it continues the calculation with new sources
 * @DMA_PREP_FENCE - tell the driver that subsequent operations depend
 *  on the result of this operation
 * @DMA_CTRL_REUSE: client can reuse the descriptor and submit again till
 *  cleared or freed
 * @DMA_PREP_CMD: tell the driver that the data passed to DMA API is command
 *  data and the descriptor should be in different format from normal
 *  data descriptors.
