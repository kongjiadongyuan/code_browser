 * intel_fbc_handle_fifo_underrun_irq - disable FBC when we get a FIFO underrun
 * @dev_priv: i915 device instance
 *
 * Without FBC, most underruns are harmless and don&apos;t really cause too many
 * problems, except for an annoying message on dmesg. With FBC, underruns can
 * become black screens or even worse, especially when paired with bad
 * watermarks. So in order for us to be on the safe side, completely disable FBC
 * in case we ever detect a FIFO underrun on any pipe. An underrun on any pipe
 * already suggests that watermarks may be bad, so try to be as safe as
 * possible.
 *
 * This function is called from the IRQ handler.
