 * regulatory_hint_country_ie - hints a country IE as a regulatory domain
 * @wiphy: the wireless device giving the hint (used only for reporting
 *	conflicts)
 * @band: the band on which the country IE was received on. This determines
 *	the band we&apos;ll process the country IE channel triplets for.
 * @country_ie: pointer to the country IE
 * @country_ie_len: length of the country IE
 *
 * We will intersect the rd with the what CRDA tells us should apply
 * for the alpha2 this country IE belongs to, this prevents APs from
 * sending us incorrect or outdated information against a country.
 *
 * The AP is expected to provide Country IE channel triplets for the
 * band it is on. It is technically possible for APs to send channel
 * country IE triplets even for channels outside of the band they are
 * in but for that they would have to use the regulatory extension
 * in combination with a triplet but this behaviour is currently
 * not observed. For this reason if a triplet is seen with channel
 * information for a band the BSS is not present in it will be ignored.
