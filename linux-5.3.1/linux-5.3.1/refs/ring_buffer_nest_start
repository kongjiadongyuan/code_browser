 * ring_buffer_nest_start - Allow to trace while nested
 * @buffer: The ring buffer to modify
 *
 * The ring buffer has a safety mechanism to prevent recursion.
 * But there may be a case where a trace needs to be done while
 * tracing something else. In this case, calling this function
 * will allow this function to nest within a currently active
 * ring_buffer_lock_reserve().
 *
 * Call this function before calling another ring_buffer_lock_reserve() and
 * call ring_buffer_nest_end() after the nested ring_buffer_unlock_commit().
