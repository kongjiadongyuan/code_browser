 * Writing is not so simple.
 *
 * If the page has buffers then they will be used for obtaining the disk
 * mapping.  We only support pages which are fully mapped-and-dirty, with a
 * special case for pages which are unmapped at the end: end-of-file.
 *
 * If the page has no buffers (preferred) then the page is mapped here.
 *
 * If all blocks are found to be contiguous then the page can go into the
 * BIO.  Otherwise fall back to the mapping&apos;s writepage().
 * 
 * FIXME: This code wants an estimate of how many pages are still to be
 * written, so it can intelligently allocate a suitably-sized BIO.  For now,
 * just allocate full-size (16-page) BIOs.
