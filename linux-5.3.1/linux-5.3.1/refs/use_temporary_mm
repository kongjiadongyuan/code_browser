 * Using a temporary mm allows to set temporary mappings that are not accessible
 * by other CPUs. Such mappings are needed to perform sensitive memory writes
 * that override the kernel memory protections (e.g., W^X), without exposing the
 * temporary page-table mappings that are required for these write operations to
 * other CPUs. Using a temporary mm also allows to avoid TLB shootdowns when the
 * mapping is torn down.
 *
 * Context: The temporary mm needs to be used exclusively by a single core. To
 *          harden security IRQs must be disabled while the temporary mm is
 *          loaded, thereby preventing interrupt handler bugs from overriding
 *          the kernel memory protection.
