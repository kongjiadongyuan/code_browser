<doc f='linux-5.3.1/include/linux/fixp-arith.h' l='91'>/**
 * fixp_sin32_rad() - calculates the sin of an angle in radians
 *
 * @radians: angle, in radians
 * @twopi: value to be used for 2*pi
 *
 * Provides a variant for the cases where just 360
 * values is not enough. This function uses linear
 * interpolation to a wider range of values given by
 * twopi var.
 *
 * Experimental tests gave a maximum difference of
 * 0.000038 between the value calculated by sin() and
 * the one produced by this function, when twopi is
 * equal to 360000. That seems to be enough precision
 * for practical purposes.
 *
 * Please notice that two high numbers for twopi could cause
 * overflows, so the routine will not allow values of twopi
 * bigger than 1^18.
