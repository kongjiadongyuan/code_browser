 *
 * DOWN: PHY device and driver are not ready for anything.  probe
 * should be called if and only if the PHY is in this state,
 * given that the PHY device exists.
 * - PHY driver probe function will set the state to READY
 *
 * READY: PHY is ready to send and receive packets, but the
 * controller is not.  By default, PHYs which do not implement
 * probe will be set to this state by phy_probe().
 * - start will set the state to UP
 *
 * UP: The PHY and attached device are ready to do work.
 * Interrupts should be started here.
 * - timer moves to NOLINK or RUNNING
 *
 * NOLINK: PHY is up, but not currently plugged in.
 * - irq or timer will set RUNNING if link comes back
 * - phy_stop moves to HALTED
 *
 * RUNNING: PHY is currently up, running, and possibly sending
 * and/or receiving packets
 * - irq or timer will set NOLINK if link goes down
 * - phy_stop moves to HALTED
 *
 * HALTED: PHY is up, but no polling or interrupts are done. Or
 * PHY is in an error state.
 * - phy_start moves to UP
