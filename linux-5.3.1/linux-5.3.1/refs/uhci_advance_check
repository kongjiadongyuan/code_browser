 * Check for queues that have made some forward progress.
 * Returns 0 if the queue is not Isochronous, is ACTIVE, and
 * has not advanced since last examined; 1 otherwise.

 * Early Intel controllers have a bug which causes qh-&gt;element sometimes
 * not to advance when a TD completes successfully.  The queue remains
 * stuck on the inactive completed TD.  We detect such cases and advance
 * the element pointer by hand.
