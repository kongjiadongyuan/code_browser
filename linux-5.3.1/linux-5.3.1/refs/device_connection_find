 * device_connection_find - Find two devices connected together
 * @dev: Device with the connection
 * @con_id: Identifier for the connection
 *
 * Find a connection with unique identifier @con_id between @dev and
 * another device. On success returns handle to the device that is connected
 * to @dev, with the reference count for the found device incremented. Returns
 * NULL if no matching connection was found, or ERR_PTR(-EPROBE_DEFER) when a
 * connection was found but the other device has not been enumerated yet.
