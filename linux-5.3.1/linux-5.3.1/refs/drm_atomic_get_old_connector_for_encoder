 * drm_atomic_get_old_connector_for_encoder - Get old connector for an encoder
 * @state: Atomic state
 * @encoder: The encoder to fetch the connector state for
 *
 * This function finds and returns the connector that was connected to @encoder
 * as specified by the @state.
 *
 * If there is no connector in @state which previously had @encoder connected to
 * it, this function will return NULL. While this may seem like an invalid use
 * case, it is sometimes useful to differentiate commits which had no prior
 * connectors attached to @encoder vs ones that did (and to inspect their
 * state). This is especially true in enable hooks because the pipeline has
 * changed.
 *
 * Returns: The old connector connected to @encoder, or NULL if the encoder is
 * not connected.
