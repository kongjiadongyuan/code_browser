 * suspend_device_irqs - disable all currently enabled interrupt lines
 *
 * During system-wide suspend or hibernation device drivers need to be
 * prevented from receiving interrupts and this function is provided
 * for this purpose.
 *
 * So we disable all interrupts and mark them IRQS_SUSPENDED except
 * for those which are unused, those which are marked as not
 * suspendable via an interrupt request with the flag IRQF_NO_SUSPEND
 * set and those which are marked as active wakeup sources.
 *
 * The active wakeup sources are handled by the flow handler entry
 * code which checks for the IRQD_WAKEUP_ARMED flag, suspends the
 * interrupt and notifies the pm core about the wakeup.
