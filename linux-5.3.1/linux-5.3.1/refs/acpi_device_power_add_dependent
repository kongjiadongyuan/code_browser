 * acpi_device_power_add_dependent - Add dependent device of this ACPI device
 * @adev: ACPI device pointer
 * @dev: Dependent device
 *
 * If @adev has non-empty _PR0 the @dev is added as dependent device to all
 * power resources returned by it. This means that whenever these power
 * resources are turned _ON the dependent devices get runtime resumed. This
 * is needed for devices such as PCI to allow its driver to re-initialize
 * it after it went to D0uninitialized.
 *
 * If @adev does not have _PR0 this does nothing.
 *
 * Returns %0 in case of success and negative errno otherwise.
