 * hwspin_unlock_irqrestore() - unlock hwspinlock, restore irq state
 * @hwlock: a previously-acquired hwspinlock which we want to unlock
 * @flags: previous caller&apos;s interrupt state to restore
 *
 * This function will unlock a specific hwspinlock, enable preemption and
 * restore the previous state of the local interrupts. It should be used
 * to undo, e.g., hwspin_trylock_irqsave().
 *
 * @hwlock must be already locked before calling this function: it is a bug
 * to call unlock on a @hwlock that is already unlocked.
