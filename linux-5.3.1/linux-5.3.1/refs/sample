 * struct sample -	Store performance sample
 * @core_avg_perf:	Ratio of APERF/MPERF which is the actual average
 *			performance during last sample period
 * @busy_scaled:	Scaled busy value which is used to calculate next
 *			P state. This can be different than core_avg_perf
 *			to account for cpu idle period
 * @aperf:		Difference of actual performance frequency clock count
 *			read from APERF MSR between last and current sample
 * @mperf:		Difference of maximum performance frequency clock count
 *			read from MPERF MSR between last and current sample
 * @tsc:		Difference of time stamp counter between last and
 *			current sample
 * @time:		Current time from scheduler
 *
 * This structure is used in the cpudata structure to store performance sample
 * data for choosing next P State.
