 * assoc_array_clear - Script deletion of all objects from an associative array
 * @array: The array to clear.
 * @ops: The operations to use.
 *
 * Precalculate and preallocate a script for the deletion of all the objects
 * from an associative array.  This results in an edit script that can either
 * be applied or cancelled.
 *
 * The function returns a pointer to an edit script if there are objects to be
 * deleted, NULL if there are no objects in the array or -ENOMEM.
 *
 * The caller should lock against other modifications and must continue to hold
 * the lock until assoc_array_apply_edit() has been called.
 *
 * Accesses to the tree may take place concurrently with this function,
 * provided they hold the RCU read lock.
