 * hibernate_preallocate_memory - Preallocate memory for hibernation image.
 *
 * To create a hibernation image it is necessary to make a copy of every page
 * frame in use.  We also need a number of page frames to be free during
 * hibernation for allocations made while saving the image and for device
 * drivers, in case they need to allocate memory from their hibernation
 * callbacks (these two numbers are given by PAGES_FOR_IO (which is a rough
 * estimate) and reserverd_size divided by PAGE_SIZE (which is tunable through
 * /sys/power/reserved_size, respectively).  To make this happen, we compute the
 * total number of available page frames and allocate at least
 *
 * ([page frames total] + PAGES_FOR_IO + [metadata pages]) / 2
 *  + 2 * DIV_ROUND_UP(reserved_size, PAGE_SIZE)
 *
 * of them, which corresponds to the maximum size of a hibernation image.
 *
 * If image_size is set below the number following from the above formula,
 * the preallocation of memory is continued until the total number of saveable
 * pages in the system is below the requested image size or the minimum
 * acceptable image size returned by minimum_image_size(), whichever is greater.
