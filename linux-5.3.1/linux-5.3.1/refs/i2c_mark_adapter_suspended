 * i2c_mark_adapter_suspended - Report suspended state of the adapter to the core
 * @adap: Adapter to mark as suspended
 *
 * When using this helper to mark an adapter as suspended, the core will reject
 * further transfers to this adapter. The usage of this helper is optional but
 * recommended for devices having distinct handlers for system suspend and
 * runtime suspend. More complex devices are free to implement custom solutions
 * to reject transfers when suspended.
