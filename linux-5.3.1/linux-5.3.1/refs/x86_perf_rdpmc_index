 * x86_perf_rdpmc_index - Return PMC counter used for event
 * @event: the perf_event to which the PMC counter was assigned
 *
 * The counter assigned to this performance event may change if interrupts
 * are enabled. This counter should thus never be used while interrupts are
 * enabled. Before this function is used to obtain the assigned counter the
 * event should be checked for validity using, for example,
 * perf_event_read_local(), within the same interrupt disabled section in
 * which this counter is planned to be used.
 *
 * Return: The index of the performance monitoring counter assigned to
 * @perf_event.
