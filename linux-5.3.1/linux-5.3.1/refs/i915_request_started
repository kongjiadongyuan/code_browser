 * i915_request_started - check if the request has begun being executed
 * @rq: the request
 *
 * If the timeline is not using initial breadcrumbs, a request is
 * considered started if the previous request on its timeline (i.e.
 * context) has been signaled.
 *
 * If the timeline is using semaphores, it will also be emitting an
 * &quot;initial breadcrumb&quot; after the semaphores are complete and just before
 * it began executing the user payload. A request can therefore be active
 * on the HW and not yet started as it is still busywaiting on its
 * dependencies (via HW semaphores).
 *
 * If the request has started, its dependencies will have been signaled
 * (either by fences or by semaphores) and it will have begun processing
 * the user payload.
 *
 * However, even if a request has started, it may have been preempted and
 * so no longer active, or it may have already completed.
 *
 * See also i915_request_is_active().
 *
 * Returns true if the request has begun executing the user payload, or
 * has completed:
