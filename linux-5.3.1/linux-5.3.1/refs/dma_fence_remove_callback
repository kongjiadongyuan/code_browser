 * dma_fence_remove_callback - remove a callback from the signaling list
 * @fence: the fence to wait on
 * @cb: the callback to remove
 *
 * Remove a previously queued callback from the fence. This function returns
 * true if the callback is successfully removed, or false if the fence has
 * already been signaled.
 *
 * *WARNING*:
 * Cancelling a callback should only be done if you really know what you&apos;re
 * doing, since deadlocks and race conditions could occur all too easily. For
 * this reason, it should only ever be done on hardware lockup recovery,
 * with a reference held to the fence.
 *
 * Behaviour is undefined if @cb has not been added to @fence using
 * dma_fence_add_callback() beforehand.
