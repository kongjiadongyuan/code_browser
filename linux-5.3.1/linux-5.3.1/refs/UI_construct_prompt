 * The following function helps construct a prompt.  object_desc is a
 * textual short description of the object, for example &quot;pass phrase&quot;,
 * and object_name is the name of the object (might be a card name or
 * a file name.
 * The returned string shall always be allocated on the heap with
 * OPENSSL_malloc(), and need to be free&apos;d with OPENSSL_free().
 *
 * If the ui_method doesn&apos;t contain a pointer to a user-defined prompt
 * constructor, a default string is built, looking like this:
 *
 *       &quot;Enter {object_desc} for {object_name}:&quot;
 *
 * So, if object_desc has the value &quot;pass phrase&quot; and object_name has
 * the value &quot;foo.key&quot;, the resulting string is:
 *
 *       &quot;Enter pass phrase for foo.key:&quot;
