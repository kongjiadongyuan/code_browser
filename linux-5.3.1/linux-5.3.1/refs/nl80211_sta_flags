 * enum nl80211_sta_flags - station flags
 *
 * Station flags. When a station is added to an AP interface, it is
 * assumed to be already associated (and hence authenticated.)
 *
 * @__NL80211_STA_FLAG_INVALID: attribute number 0 is reserved
 * @NL80211_STA_FLAG_AUTHORIZED: station is authorized (802.1X)
 * @NL80211_STA_FLAG_SHORT_PREAMBLE: station is capable of receiving frames
 *	with short barker preamble
 * @NL80211_STA_FLAG_WME: station is WME/QoS capable
 * @NL80211_STA_FLAG_MFP: station uses management frame protection
 * @NL80211_STA_FLAG_AUTHENTICATED: station is authenticated
 * @NL80211_STA_FLAG_TDLS_PEER: station is a TDLS peer -- this flag should
 *	only be used in managed mode (even in the flags mask). Note that the
 *	flag can&apos;t be changed, it is only valid while adding a station, and
 *	attempts to change it will silently be ignored (rather than rejected
 *	as errors.)
 * @NL80211_STA_FLAG_ASSOCIATED: station is associated; used with drivers
 *	that support %NL80211_FEATURE_FULL_AP_CLIENT_STATE to transition a
 *	previously added station into associated state
 * @NL80211_STA_FLAG_MAX: highest station flag number currently defined
 * @__NL80211_STA_FLAG_AFTER_LAST: internal use
