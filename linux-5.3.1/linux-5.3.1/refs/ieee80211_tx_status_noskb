 * ieee80211_tx_status_noskb - transmit status callback without skb
 *
 * This function can be used as a replacement for ieee80211_tx_status
 * in drivers that cannot reliably map tx status information back to
 * specific skbs.
 *
 * Calls to this function for a single hardware must be synchronized
 * against each other. Calls to this function, ieee80211_tx_status_ni()
 * and ieee80211_tx_status_irqsafe() may not be mixed for a single hardware.
 *
 * @hw: the hardware the frame was transmitted by
 * @sta: the receiver station to which this packet is sent
 *	(NULL for multicast packets)
 * @info: tx status information
