 * rfkill_init_sw_state - Initialize persistent software block state
 * @rfkill: pointer to the rfkill class to modify.
 * @blocked: the current software block state to set
 *
 * rfkill drivers that preserve their software block state over power off
 * use this function to notify the rfkill core (and through that also
 * userspace) of their initial state.  It should only be used before
 * registration.
 *
 * In addition, it marks the device as &quot;persistent&quot;, an attribute which
 * can be read by userspace.  Persistent devices are expected to preserve
 * their own state when suspended.
