 * These functions support sending signals using preallocated sigqueue
 * structures.  This is needed &quot;because realtime applications cannot
 * afford to lose notifications of asynchronous events, like timer
 * expirations or I/O completions&quot;.  In the case of POSIX Timers
 * we allocate the sigqueue structure from the timer_create.  If this
 * allocation fails we are able to report the failure to the application
 * with an EAGAIN error.
