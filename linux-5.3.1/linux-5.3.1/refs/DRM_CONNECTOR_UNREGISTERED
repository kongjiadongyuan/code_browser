	 * @DRM_CONNECTOR_UNREGISTERED: The connector has either been exposed
	 * to userspace and has since been unregistered and removed from
	 * userspace, or the connector was unregistered before it had a chance
	 * to be exposed to userspace (e.g. still in the
	 * @DRM_CONNECTOR_INITIALIZING state). When a connector is
	 * unregistered, there are additional restrictions to how its state
	 * may be modified:
	 *
	 * - An unregistered connector may only have its DPMS changed from
	 *   On-&gt;Off. Once DPMS is changed to Off, it may not be switched back
	 *   to On.
	 * - Modesets are not allowed on unregistered connectors, unless they
	 *   would result in disabling its assigned CRTCs. This means
	 *   disabling a CRTC on an unregistered connector is OK, but enabling
	 *   one is not.
	 * - Removing a CRTC from an unregistered connector is OK, but new
	 *   CRTCs may never be assigned to an unregistered connector.
