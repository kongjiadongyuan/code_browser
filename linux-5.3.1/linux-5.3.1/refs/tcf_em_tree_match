 * @skb: socket buffer of the packet in question
 * @tree: ematch tree to be used for evaluation
 * @info: packet information examined by classifier
 *
 * This function matches @skb against the ematch tree in @tree by going
 * through all ematches respecting their logic relations returning
 * as soon as the result is obvious.
 *
 * Returns 1 if the ematch tree as-one matches, no ematches are configured
 * or ematch is not enabled in the kernel, otherwise 0 is returned.
