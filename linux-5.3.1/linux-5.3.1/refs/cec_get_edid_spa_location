 * cec_get_edid_spa_location() - find location of the Source Physical Address
 *
 * @edid: the EDID
 * @size: the size of the EDID
 *
 * This EDID is expected to be a CEA-861 compliant, which means that there are
 * at least two blocks and one or more of the extensions blocks are CEA-861
 * blocks.
 *
 * The returned location is guaranteed to be &lt;= size-2.
 *
 * This is an inline function since it is used by both CEC and V4L2.
 * Ideally this would go in a module shared by both, but it is overkill to do
 * that for just a single function.
