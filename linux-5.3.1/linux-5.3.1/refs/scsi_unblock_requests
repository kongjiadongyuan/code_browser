 * Function:    scsi_unblock_requests()
 *
 * Purpose:     Utility function used by low-level drivers to allow further
 *		commands from being queued to the device.
 *
 * Arguments:   shost       - Host in question
 *
 * Returns:     Nothing
 *
 * Lock status: No locks are assumed held.
 *
 * Notes:       There is no timer nor any other means by which the requests
 *		get unblocked other than the low-level driver calling
 *		scsi_unblock_requests().
 *
 *		This is done as an API function so that changes to the
 *		internals of the scsi mid-layer won&apos;t require wholesale
 *		changes to drivers that use this feature.
