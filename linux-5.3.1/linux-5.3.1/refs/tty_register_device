 *	tty_register_device - register a tty device
 *	@driver: the tty driver that describes the tty device
 *	@index: the index in the tty driver for this tty device
 *	@device: a struct device that is associated with this tty device.
 *		This field is optional, if there is no known struct device
 *		for this tty device it can be set to NULL safely.
 *
 *	Returns a pointer to the struct device for this tty device
 *	(or ERR_PTR(-EFOO) on error).
 *
 *	This call is required to be made to register an individual tty device
 *	if the tty driver&apos;s flags have the TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_DEV bit set.  If
 *	that bit is not set, this function should not be called by a tty
 *	driver.
