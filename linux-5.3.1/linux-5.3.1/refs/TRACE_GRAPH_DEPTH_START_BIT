	 * In the very unlikely case that an interrupt came in
	 * at a start of graph tracing, and we want to trace
	 * the function in that interrupt, the depth can be greater
	 * than zero, because of the preempted start of a previous
	 * trace. In an even more unlikely case, depth could be 2
	 * if a softirq interrupted the start of graph tracing,
	 * followed by an interrupt preempting a start of graph
	 * tracing in the softirq, and depth can even be 3
	 * if an NMI came in at the start of an interrupt function
	 * that preempted a softirq start of a function that
	 * preempted normal context!!!! Luckily, it can&apos;t be
	 * greater than 3, so the next two bits are a mask
	 * of what the depth is when we set TRACE_GRAPH_BIT
