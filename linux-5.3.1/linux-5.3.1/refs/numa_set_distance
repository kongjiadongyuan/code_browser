 * numa_set_distance - Set NUMA distance from one NUMA to another
 * @from: the &apos;from&apos; node to set distance
 * @to: the &apos;to&apos;  node to set distance
 * @distance: NUMA distance
 *
 * Set the distance from node @from to @to to @distance.  If distance table
 * doesn&apos;t exist, one which is large enough to accommodate all the currently
 * known nodes will be created.
 *
 * If such table cannot be allocated, a warning is printed and further
 * calls are ignored until the distance table is reset with
 * numa_reset_distance().
 *
 * If @from or @to is higher than the highest known node or lower than zero
 * at the time of table creation or @distance doesn&apos;t make sense, the call
 * is ignored.
 * This is to allow simplification of specific NUMA config implementations.
