 * intel_wakeref_put: Release the wakeref
 * @i915: the drm_i915_private device
 * @wf: the wakeref
 * @fn: callback for releasing the wakeref, called only on final release.
 *
 * Release our hold on the wakeref. When there are no more users,
 * the runtime pm wakeref will be released after the @fn callback is called
 * underneath the wakeref mutex.
 *
 * Note that @fn is allowed to fail, in which case the runtime-pm wakeref
 * is retained and an error reported.
 *
 * Returns: 0 if the wakeref was released successfully, or a negative error
 * code otherwise.
