 * intel_wakeref_get: Acquire the wakeref
 * @i915: the drm_i915_private device
 * @wf: the wakeref
 * @fn: callback for acquired the wakeref, called only on first acquire.
 *
 * Acquire a hold on the wakeref. The first user to do so, will acquire
 * the runtime pm wakeref and then call the @fn underneath the wakeref
 * mutex.
 *
 * Note that @fn is allowed to fail, in which case the runtime-pm wakeref
 * will be released and the acquisition unwound, and an error reported.
 *
 * Returns: 0 if the wakeref was acquired successfully, or a negative error
 * code otherwise.
