 * kthread_worker_fn - kthread function to process kthread_worker
 * @worker_ptr: pointer to initialized kthread_worker
 *
 * This function implements the main cycle of kthread worker. It processes
 * work_list until it is stopped with kthread_stop(). It sleeps when the queue
 * is empty.
 *
 * The works are not allowed to keep any locks, disable preemption or interrupts
 * when they finish. There is defined a safe point for freezing when one work
 * finishes and before a new one is started.
 *
 * Also the works must not be handled by more than one worker at the same time,
 * see also kthread_queue_work().
