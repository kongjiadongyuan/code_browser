 * enum nl80211_frequency_attr - frequency attributes
 * @__NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_INVALID: attribute number 0 is reserved
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_FREQ: Frequency in MHz
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_DISABLED: Channel is disabled in current
 *	regulatory domain.
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_NO_IR: no mechanisms that initiate radiation
 * 	are permitted on this channel, this includes sending probe
 * 	requests, or modes of operation that require beaconing.
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_RADAR: Radar detection is mandatory
 *	on this channel in current regulatory domain.
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_MAX_TX_POWER: Maximum transmission power in mBm
 *	(100 * dBm).
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_DFS_STATE: current state for DFS
 *	(enum nl80211_dfs_state)
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_DFS_TIME: time in miliseconds for how long
 *	this channel is in this DFS state.
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_NO_HT40_MINUS: HT40- isn&apos;t possible with this
 *	channel as the control channel
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_NO_HT40_PLUS: HT40+ isn&apos;t possible with this
 *	channel as the control channel
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_NO_80MHZ: any 80 MHz channel using this channel
 *	as the primary or any of the secondary channels isn&apos;t possible,
 *	this includes 80+80 channels
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_NO_160MHZ: any 160 MHz (but not 80+80) channel
 *	using this channel as the primary or any of the secondary channels
 *	isn&apos;t possible
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_DFS_CAC_TIME: DFS CAC time in milliseconds.
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_INDOOR_ONLY: Only indoor use is permitted on this
 *	channel. A channel that has the INDOOR_ONLY attribute can only be
 *	used when there is a clear assessment that the device is operating in
 *	an indoor surroundings, i.e., it is connected to AC power (and not
 *	through portable DC inverters) or is under the control of a master
 *	that is acting as an AP and is connected to AC power.
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_IR_CONCURRENT: IR operation is allowed on this
 *	channel if it&apos;s connected concurrently to a BSS on the same channel on
 *	the 2 GHz band or to a channel in the same UNII band (on the 5 GHz
 *	band), and IEEE80211_CHAN_RADAR is not set. Instantiating a GO or TDLS
 *	off-channel on a channel that has the IR_CONCURRENT attribute set can be
 *	done when there is a clear assessment that the device is operating under
 *	the guidance of an authorized master, i.e., setting up a GO or TDLS
 *	off-channel while the device is also connected to an AP with DFS and
 *	radar detection on the UNII band (it is up to user-space, i.e.,
 *	wpa_supplicant to perform the required verifications). Using this
 *	attribute for IR is disallowed for master interfaces (IBSS, AP).
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_NO_20MHZ: 20 MHz operation is not allowed
 *	on this channel in current regulatory domain.
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_NO_10MHZ: 10 MHz operation is not allowed
 *	on this channel in current regulatory domain.
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_WMM: this channel has wmm limitations.
 *	This is a nested attribute that contains the wmm limitation per AC.
 *	(see &amp;enum nl80211_wmm_rule)
 * @NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_MAX: highest frequency attribute number
 *	currently defined
 * @__NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_AFTER_LAST: internal use
 *
 * See https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/comments/GetPublishedDocument.html?id=327&amp;tn=528122
 * for more information on the FCC description of the relaxations allowed
 * by NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_INDOOR_ONLY and
 * NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_IR_CONCURRENT.
