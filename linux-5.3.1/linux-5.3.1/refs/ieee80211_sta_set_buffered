<doc f='linux-5.3.1/include/net/mac80211.h' l='4445'>/**
 * ieee80211_sta_set_buffered - inform mac80211 about driver-buffered frames
 * @sta: &amp;struct ieee80211_sta pointer for the sleeping station
 * @tid: the TID that has buffered frames
 * @buffered: indicates whether or not frames are buffered for this TID
 *
 * If a driver buffers frames for a powersave station instead of passing
 * them back to mac80211 for retransmission, the station may still need
 * to be told that there are buffered frames via the TIM bit.
 *
 * This function informs mac80211 whether or not there are frames that are
 * buffered in the driver for a given TID; mac80211 can then use this data
 * to set the TIM bit (NOTE: This may call back into the driver&apos;s set_tim
 * call! Beware of the locking!)
 *
 * If all frames are released to the station (due to PS-poll or uAPSD)
 * then the driver needs to inform mac80211 that there no longer are
 * frames buffered. However, when the station wakes up mac80211 assumes
 * that all buffered frames will be transmitted and clears this data,
 * drivers need to make sure they inform mac80211 about all buffered
 * frames on the sleep transition (sta_notify() with %STA_NOTIFY_SLEEP).
 *
 * Note that technically mac80211 only needs to know this per AC, not per
 * TID, but since driver buffering will inevitably happen per TID (since
 * it is related to aggregation) it is easier to make mac80211 map the
 * TID to the AC as required instead of keeping track in all drivers that
 * use this API.
