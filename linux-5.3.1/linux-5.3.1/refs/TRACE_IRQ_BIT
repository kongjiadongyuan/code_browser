 * Abuse of the trace_recursion.
 * As we need a way to maintain state if we are tracing the function
 * graph in irq because we want to trace a particular function that
 * was called in irq context but we have irq tracing off. Since this
 * can only be modified by current, we can reuse trace_recursion.
