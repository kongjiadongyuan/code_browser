 * intel_fbc_choose_crtc - select a CRTC to enable FBC on
 * @dev_priv: i915 device instance
 * @state: the atomic state structure
 *
 * This function looks at the proposed state for CRTCs and planes, then chooses
 * which pipe is going to have FBC by setting intel_crtc_state-&gt;enable_fbc to
 * true.
 *
 * Later, intel_fbc_enable is going to look for state-&gt;enable_fbc and then maybe
 * enable FBC for the chosen CRTC. If it does, it will set dev_priv-&gt;fbc.crtc.
