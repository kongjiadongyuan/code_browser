 * @cookie: The cookie representing the inode&apos;s cache object.
 * @pages: The netfs pages that we canceled write on in readpages()
 *
 * Uncache/unreserve the pages reserved earlier in readpages() via
 * fscache_readpages_or_alloc() and similar.  In most successful caches in
 * readpages() this doesn&apos;t do anything.  In cases when the underlying netfs&apos;s
 * readahead failed we need to clean up the pagelist (unmark and uncache).

 * This function may sleep as it may have to clean up disk state.
