 * hwspin_lock_timeout() - lock an hwspinlock with timeout limit
 * @hwlock: the hwspinlock to be locked
 * @to: timeout value in msecs
 *
 * This function locks the underlying @hwlock. If the @hwlock
 * is already taken, the function will busy loop waiting for it to
 * be released, but give up when @timeout msecs have elapsed.
 *
 * Upon a successful return from this function, preemption is disabled
 * so the caller must not sleep, and is advised to release the hwspinlock
 * as soon as possible.
 * This is required in order to minimize remote cores polling on the
 * hardware interconnect.
 *
 * Returns 0 when the @hwlock was successfully taken, and an appropriate
 * error code otherwise (most notably an -ETIMEDOUT if the @hwlock is still
 * busy after @timeout msecs). The function will never sleep.
