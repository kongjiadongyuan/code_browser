 * Mark the specified CPU as being online so that subsequent grace periods
 * (both expedited and normal) will wait on it.  Note that this means that
 * incoming CPUs are not allowed to use RCU read-side critical sections
 * until this function is called.  Failing to observe this restriction
 * will result in lockdep splats.
 *
 * Note that this function is special in that it is invoked directly
 * from the incoming CPU rather than from the cpuhp_step mechanism.
 * This is because this function must be invoked at a precise location.
