 * This function is used when the first inode for this wb is marked dirty. It
 * wakes-up the corresponding bdi thread which should then take care of the
 * periodic background write-out of dirty inodes. Since the write-out would
 * starts only &apos;dirty_writeback_interval&apos; centisecs from now anyway, we just
 * set up a timer which wakes the bdi thread up later.
 *
 * Note, we wouldn&apos;t bother setting up the timer, but this function is on the
 * fast-path (used by &apos;__mark_inode_dirty()&apos;), so we save few context switches
 * by delaying the wake-up.
 *
 * We have to be careful not to postpone flush work if it is scheduled for
 * earlier. Thus we use queue_delayed_work().
