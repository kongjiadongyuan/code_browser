 * hwspin_unlock_raw() - unlock hwspinlock
 * @hwlock: a previously-acquired hwspinlock which we want to unlock

 * This function will unlock a specific hwspinlock.

 * @hwlock must be already locked (e.g. by hwspin_trylock()) before calling
 * this function: it is a bug to call unlock on a @hwlock that is already
 * unlocked.
