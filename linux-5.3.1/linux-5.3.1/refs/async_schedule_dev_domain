<doc f='linux-5.3.1/include/linux/async.h' l='93'>/**
 * async_schedule_dev_domain - A device specific version of async_schedule_domain
 * @func: function to execute asynchronously
 * @dev: device argument to be passed to function
 * @domain: the domain
 *
 * Returns an async_cookie_t that may be used for checkpointing later.
 * @dev is used as both the argument for the function and to provide NUMA
 * context for where to run the function. By doing this we can try to
 * provide for the best possible outcome by operating on the device on the
 * CPUs closest to the device.
 * @domain may be used in the async_synchronize_*_domain() functions to
 * wait within a certain synchronization domain rather than globally.
 * Note: This function may be called from atomic or non-atomic contexts.
