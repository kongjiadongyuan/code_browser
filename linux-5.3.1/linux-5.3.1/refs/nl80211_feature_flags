 * enum nl80211_feature_flags - device/driver features
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_SK_TX_STATUS: This driver supports reflecting back
 *	TX status to the socket error queue when requested with the
 *	socket option.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_HT_IBSS: This driver supports IBSS with HT datarates.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_INACTIVITY_TIMER: This driver takes care of freeing up
 *	the connected inactive stations in AP mode.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_CELL_BASE_REG_HINTS: This driver has been tested
 *	to work properly to suppport receiving regulatory hints from
 *	cellular base stations.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_P2P_DEVICE_NEEDS_CHANNEL: (no longer available, only
 *	here to reserve the value for API/ABI compatibility)
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_SAE: This driver supports simultaneous authentication of
 *	equals (SAE) with user space SME (NL80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE) in station
 *	mode
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_LOW_PRIORITY_SCAN: This driver supports low priority scan
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_SCAN_FLUSH: Scan flush is supported
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_AP_SCAN: Support scanning using an AP vif
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_VIF_TXPOWER: The driver supports per-vif TX power setting
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_NEED_OBSS_SCAN: The driver expects userspace to perform
 *	OBSS scans and generate 20/40 BSS coex reports. This flag is used only
 *	for drivers implementing the CONNECT API, for AUTH/ASSOC it is implied.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_P2P_GO_CTWIN: P2P GO implementation supports CT Window
 *	setting
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_P2P_GO_OPPPS: P2P GO implementation supports opportunistic
 *	powersave
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_FULL_AP_CLIENT_STATE: The driver supports full state
 *	transitions for AP clients. Without this flag (and if the driver
 *	doesn&apos;t have the AP SME in the device) the driver supports adding
 *	stations only when they&apos;re associated and adds them in associated
 *	state (to later be transitioned into authorized), with this flag
 *	they should be added before even sending the authentication reply
 *	and then transitioned into authenticated, associated and authorized
 *	states using station flags.
 *	Note that even for drivers that support this, the default is to add
 *	stations in authenticated/associated state, so to add unauthenticated
 *	stations the authenticated/associated bits have to be set in the mask.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_ADVERTISE_CHAN_LIMITS: cfg80211 advertises channel limits
 *	(HT40, VHT 80/160 MHz) if this flag is set
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_USERSPACE_MPM: This driver supports a userspace Mesh
 *	Peering Management entity which may be implemented by registering for
 *	beacons or NL80211_CMD_NEW_PEER_CANDIDATE events. The mesh beacon is
 *	still generated by the driver.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_ACTIVE_MONITOR: This driver supports an active monitor
 *	interface. An active monitor interface behaves like a normal monitor
 *	interface, but gets added to the driver. It ensures that incoming
 *	unicast packets directed at the configured interface address get ACKed.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_AP_MODE_CHAN_WIDTH_CHANGE: This driver supports dynamic
 *	channel bandwidth change (e.g., HT 20 &lt;-&gt; 40 MHz channel) during the
 *	lifetime of a BSS.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_DS_PARAM_SET_IE_IN_PROBES: This device adds a DS Parameter
 *	Set IE to probe requests.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_WFA_TPC_IE_IN_PROBES: This device adds a WFA TPC Report IE
 *	to probe requests.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_QUIET: This device, in client mode, supports Quiet Period
 *	requests sent to it by an AP.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_TX_POWER_INSERTION: This device is capable of inserting the
 *	current tx power value into the TPC Report IE in the spectrum
 *	management TPC Report action frame, and in the Radio Measurement Link
 *	Measurement Report action frame.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_ACKTO_ESTIMATION: This driver supports dynamic ACK timeout
 *	estimation (dynack). %NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_DYN_ACK flag attribute is used
 *	to enable dynack.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_STATIC_SMPS: Device supports static spatial
 *	multiplexing powersave, ie. can turn off all but one chain
 *	even on HT connections that should be using more chains.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_DYNAMIC_SMPS: Device supports dynamic spatial
 *	multiplexing powersave, ie. can turn off all but one chain
 *	and then wake the rest up as required after, for example,
 *	rts/cts handshake.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_SUPPORTS_WMM_ADMISSION: the device supports setting up WMM
 *	TSPEC sessions (TID aka TSID 0-7) with the %NL80211_CMD_ADD_TX_TS
 *	command. Standard IEEE 802.11 TSPEC setup is not yet supported, it
 *	needs to be able to handle Block-Ack agreements and other things.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_MAC_ON_CREATE: Device supports configuring
 *	the vif&apos;s MAC address upon creation.
 *	See &apos;macaddr&apos; field in the vif_params (cfg80211.h).
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_TDLS_CHANNEL_SWITCH: Driver supports channel switching when
 *	operating as a TDLS peer.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_SCAN_RANDOM_MAC_ADDR: This device/driver supports using a
 *	random MAC address during scan (if the device is unassociated); the
 *	%NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_RANDOM_ADDR flag may be set for scans and the MAC
 *	address mask/value will be used.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_SCHED_SCAN_RANDOM_MAC_ADDR: This device/driver supports
 *	using a random MAC address for every scan iteration during scheduled
 *	scan (while not associated), the %NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_RANDOM_ADDR may
 *	be set for scheduled scan and the MAC address mask/value will be used.
 * @NL80211_FEATURE_ND_RANDOM_MAC_ADDR: This device/driver supports using a
 *	random MAC address for every scan iteration during &quot;net detect&quot;, i.e.
 *	scan in unassociated WoWLAN, the %NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_RANDOM_ADDR may
 *	be set for scheduled scan and the MAC address mask/value will be used.
