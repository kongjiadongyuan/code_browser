 * acpi_parse_spcr() - parse ACPI SPCR table and add preferred console
 *
 * @enable_earlycon: set up earlycon for the console specified by the table
 * @enable_console: setup the console specified by the table.
 *
 * For the architectures with support for ACPI, CONFIG_ACPI_SPCR_TABLE may be
 * defined to parse ACPI SPCR table.  As a result of the parsing preferred
 * console is registered and if @enable_earlycon is true, earlycon is set up.
 * If @enable_console is true the system console is also configured.
 *
 * When CONFIG_ACPI_SPCR_TABLE is defined, this function should be called
 * from arch initialization code as soon as the DT/ACPI decision is made.
