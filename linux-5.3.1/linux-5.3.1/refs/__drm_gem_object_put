 * __drm_gem_object_put - raw function to release a GEM buffer object reference
 * @obj: GEM buffer object
 *
 * This function is meant to be used by drivers which are not encumbered with
 * &amp;drm_device.struct_mutex legacy locking and which are using the
 * gem_free_object_unlocked callback. It avoids all the locking checks and
 * locking overhead of drm_gem_object_put() and drm_gem_object_put_unlocked().
 *
 * Drivers should never call this directly in their code. Instead they should
 * wrap it up into a ``driver_gem_object_put(struct driver_gem_object *obj)``
 * wrapper function, and use that. Shared code should never call this, to
 * avoid breaking drivers by accident which still depend upon
 * &amp;drm_device.struct_mutex locking.
