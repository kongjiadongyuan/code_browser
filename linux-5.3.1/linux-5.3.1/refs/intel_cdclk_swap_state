 * intel_cdclk_swap_state - make atomic CDCLK configuration effective
 * @state: atomic state
 *
 * This is the CDCLK version of drm_atomic_helper_swap_state() since the
 * helper does not handle driver-specific global state.
 *
 * Similarly to the atomic helpers this function does a complete swap,
 * i.e. it also puts the old state into @state. This is used by the commit
 * code to determine how CDCLK has changed (for instance did it increase or
 * decrease).
