 * ring_buffer_write - write data to the buffer without reserving
 * @buffer: The ring buffer to write to.
 * @length: The length of the data being written (excluding the event header)
 * @data: The data to write to the buffer.
 *
 * This is like ring_buffer_lock_reserve and ring_buffer_unlock_commit as
 * one function. If you already have the data to write to the buffer, it
 * may be easier to simply call this function.
 *
 * Note, like ring_buffer_lock_reserve, the length is the length of the data
 * and not the length of the event which would hold the header.
