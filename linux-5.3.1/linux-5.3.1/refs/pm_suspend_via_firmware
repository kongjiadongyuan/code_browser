 * pm_suspend_via_firmware - Check if platform firmware will suspend the system.
 *
 * To be called during system-wide power management transitions to sleep states
 * or during the subsequent system-wide transitions back to the working state.
 *
 * Return &apos;true&apos; if the platform firmware is going to be invoked at the end of
 * the system-wide power management transition (to a sleep state) in progress in
 * order to complete it, or if the platform firmware has been invoked in order
 * to complete the last (or preceding) transition of the system to a sleep
 * state.
 *
 * This matters if the caller needs or wants to carry out some special actions
 * depending on whether or not control will be passed to the platform firmware
 * subsequently (for example, the device may need to be reset before letting the
 * platform firmware manipulate it, which is not necessary when the platform
 * firmware is not going to be invoked) or when such special actions may have
 * been carried out during the preceding transition of the system to a sleep
 * state (as they may need to be taken into account).
