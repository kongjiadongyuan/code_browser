 * enum ieee80211_key_flags - key flags
 *
 * These flags are used for communication about keys between the driver
 * and mac80211, with the @flags parameter of &amp;struct ieee80211_key_conf.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_GENERATE_IV: This flag should be set by the
 *	driver to indicate that it requires IV generation for this
 *	particular key. Setting this flag does not necessarily mean that SKBs
 *	will have sufficient tailroom for ICV or MIC.
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_GENERATE_MMIC: This flag should be set by
 *	the driver for a TKIP key if it requires Michael MIC
 *	generation in software.
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_PAIRWISE: Set by mac80211, this flag indicates
 *	that the key is pairwise rather then a shared key.
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_SW_MGMT_TX: This flag should be set by the driver for a
 *	CCMP/GCMP key if it requires CCMP/GCMP encryption of management frames
 *	(MFP) to be done in software.
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_PUT_IV_SPACE: This flag should be set by the driver
 *	if space should be prepared for the IV, but the IV
 *	itself should not be generated. Do not set together with
 *	@IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_GENERATE_IV on the same key. Setting this flag does
 *	not necessarily mean that SKBs will have sufficient tailroom for ICV or
 *	MIC.
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_RX_MGMT: This key will be used to decrypt received
 *	management frames. The flag can help drivers that have a hardware
 *	crypto implementation that doesn&apos;t deal with management frames
 *	properly by allowing them to not upload the keys to hardware and
 *	fall back to software crypto. Note that this flag deals only with
 *	RX, if your crypto engine can&apos;t deal with TX you can also set the
 *	%IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_SW_MGMT_TX flag to encrypt such frames in SW.
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_GENERATE_IV_MGMT: This flag should be set by the
 *	driver for a CCMP/GCMP key to indicate that is requires IV generation
 *	only for managment frames (MFP).
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_RESERVE_TAILROOM: This flag should be set by the
 *	driver for a key to indicate that sufficient tailroom must always
 *	be reserved for ICV or MIC, even when HW encryption is enabled.
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_PUT_MIC_SPACE: This flag should be set by the driver for
 *	a TKIP key if it only requires MIC space. Do not set together with
 *	@IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_GENERATE_MMIC on the same key.
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_NO_AUTO_TX: Key needs explicit Tx activation.
