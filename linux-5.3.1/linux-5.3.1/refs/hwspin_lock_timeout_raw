 * hwspin_lock_timeout_raw() - lock an hwspinlock with timeout limit
 * @hwlock: the hwspinlock to be locked
 * @to: timeout value in msecs
 *
 * This function locks the underlying @hwlock. If the @hwlock
 * is already taken, the function will busy loop waiting for it to
 * be released, but give up when @timeout msecs have elapsed.
 *
 * Caution: User must protect the routine of getting hardware lock with mutex
 * or spinlock to avoid dead-lock, that will let user can do some time-consuming
 * or sleepable operations under the hardware lock.
 *
 * Returns 0 when the @hwlock was successfully taken, and an appropriate
 * error code otherwise (most notably an -ETIMEDOUT if the @hwlock is still
 * busy after @timeout msecs). The function will never sleep.
