 * ib_device_try_get: Hold a registration lock
 * device: The device to lock
 *
 * A device under an active registration lock cannot become unregistered. It
 * is only possible to obtain a registration lock on a device that is fully
 * registered, otherwise this function returns false.
 *
 * The registration lock is only necessary for actions which require the
 * device to still be registered. Uses that only require the device pointer to
 * be valid should use get_device(&amp;ibdev-&gt;dev) to hold the memory.
