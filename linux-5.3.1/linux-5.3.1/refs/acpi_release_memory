 * acpi_release_memory - Release any mappings done to a memory region
 * @handle: Handle to namespace node
 * @res: Memory resource
 * @level: A level that terminates the search
 *
 * Walks through @handle and unmaps all SystemMemory Operation Regions that
 * overlap with @res and that have already been activated (mapped).
 *
 * This is a helper that allows drivers to place special requirements on memory
 * region that may overlap with operation regions, primarily allowing them to
 * safely map the region as non-cached memory.
 *
 * The unmapped Operation Regions will be automatically remapped next time they
 * are called, so the drivers do not need to do anything else.
