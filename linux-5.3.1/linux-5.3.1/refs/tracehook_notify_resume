 * tracehook_notify_resume - report when about to return to user mode
 * @regs:		user-mode registers of @current task
 *
 * This is called when %TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME has been set.  Now we are
 * about to return to user mode, and the user state in @regs can be
 * inspected or adjusted.  The caller in arch code has cleared
 * %TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME before the call.  If the flag gets set again
 * asynchronously, this will be called again before we return to
 * user mode.
 *
 * Called without locks.
