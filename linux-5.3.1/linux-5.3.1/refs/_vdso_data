 * We use the hidden visibility to prevent the compiler from generating a GOT
 * relocation. Not only is going through a GOT useless (the entry couldn&apos;t and
 * must not be overridden by another library), it does not even work: the linker
 * cannot generate an absolute address to the data page.
 *
 * With the hidden visibility, the compiler simply generates a PC-relative
 * relocation, and this is what we need.
