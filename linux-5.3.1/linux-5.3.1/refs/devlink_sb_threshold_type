 * dynamic threshold - limiting the maximum number of bytes
 *   based on the currently available free space in the shared buffer pool.
 *   In this mode, the maximum quota is calculated based
 *   on the following formula:
 *     max_quota = alpha / (1 + alpha) * Free_Buffer
 *   While Free_Buffer is the amount of none-occupied buffer associated to
 *   the relevant pool.
 *   The value range which can be passed is 0-20 and serves
 *   for computation of alpha by following formula:
 *     alpha = 2 ^ (passed_value - 10)
