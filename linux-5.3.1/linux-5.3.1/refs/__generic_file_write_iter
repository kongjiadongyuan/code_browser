 * __generic_file_write_iter - write data to a file
 * @iocb:	IO state structure (file, offset, etc.)
 * @from:	iov_iter with data to write
 *
 * This function does all the work needed for actually writing data to a
 * file. It does all basic checks, removes SUID from the file, updates
 * modification times and calls proper subroutines depending on whether we
 * do direct IO or a standard buffered write.
 *
 * It expects i_mutex to be grabbed unless we work on a block device or similar
 * object which does not need locking at all.
 *
 * This function does *not* take care of syncing data in case of O_SYNC write.
 * A caller has to handle it. This is mainly due to the fact that we want to
 * avoid syncing under i_mutex.
 *
 * Return:
 * * number of bytes written, even for truncated writes
 * * negative error code if no data has been written at all
