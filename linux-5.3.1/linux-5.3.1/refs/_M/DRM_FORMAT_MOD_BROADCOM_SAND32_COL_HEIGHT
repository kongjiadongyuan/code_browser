 * Broadcom SAND format
 *
 * This is the native format that the H.264 codec block uses.  For VC4
 * HVS, it is only valid for H.264 (NV12/21) and RGBA modes.
 *
 * The image can be considered to be split into columns, and the
 * columns are placed consecutively into memory.  The width of those
 * columns can be either 32, 64, 128, or 256 pixels, but in practice
 * only 128 pixel columns are used.
 *
 * The pitch between the start of each column is set to optimally
 * switch between SDRAM banks. This is passed as the number of lines
 * of column width in the modifier (we can&apos;t use the stride value due
 * to various core checks that look at it , so you should set the
 * stride to width*cpp).
 *
 * Note that the column height for this format modifier is the same
 * for all of the planes, assuming that each column contains both Y
 * and UV.  Some SAND-using hardware stores UV in a separate tiled
 * image from Y to reduce the column height, which is not supported
 * with these modifiers.
