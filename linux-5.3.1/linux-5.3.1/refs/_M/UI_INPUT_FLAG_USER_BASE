 * The user of these routines may want to define flags of their own.  The core
 * UI won&apos;t look at those, but will pass them on to the method routines.  They
 * must use higher bits so they don&apos;t get confused with the UI bits above.
 * UI_INPUT_FLAG_USER_BASE tells which is the lowest bit to use.  A good
 * example of use is this:
 *
 *    #define MY_UI_FLAG1       (0x01 &lt;&lt; UI_INPUT_FLAG_USER_BASE)
 *
