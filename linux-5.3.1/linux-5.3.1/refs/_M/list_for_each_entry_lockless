 * list_for_each_entry_lockless - iterate over rcu list of given type
 * @pos:	the type * to use as a loop cursor.
 * @head:	the head for your list.
 * @member:	the name of the list_struct within the struct.
 *
 * This primitive may safely run concurrently with the _rcu
 * list-mutation primitives such as list_add_rcu(), but requires some
 * implicit RCU read-side guarding.  One example is running within a special
 * exception-time environment where preemption is disabled and where lockdep
 * cannot be invoked.  Another example is when items are added to the list,
 * but never deleted.
