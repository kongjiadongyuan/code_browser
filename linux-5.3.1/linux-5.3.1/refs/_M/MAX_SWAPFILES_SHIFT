 * MAX_SWAPFILES defines the maximum number of swaptypes: things which can
 * be swapped to.  The swap type and the offset into that swap type are
 * encoded into pte&apos;s and into pgoff_t&apos;s in the swapcache.  Using five bits
 * for the type means that the maximum number of swapcache pages is 27 bits
 * on 32-bit-pgoff_t architectures.  And that assumes that the architecture packs
 * the type/offset into the pte as 5/27 as well.
