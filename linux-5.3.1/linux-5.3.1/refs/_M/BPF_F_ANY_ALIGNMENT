 * verifier will allow any alignment whatsoever.  On platforms
 * with strict alignment requirements for loads ands stores (such
 * as sparc and mips) the verifier validates that all loads and
 * stores provably follow this requirement.  This flag turns that
 * checking and enforcement off.
 *
 * It is mostly used for testing when we want to validate the
 * context and memory access aspects of the verifier, but because
 * of an unaligned access the alignment check would trigger before
 * the one we are interested in.
