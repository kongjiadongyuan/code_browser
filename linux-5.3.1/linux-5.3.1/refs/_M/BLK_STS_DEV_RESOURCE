 * BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE is returned from the driver to the block layer if
 * device related resources are unavailable, but the driver can guarantee
 * that the queue will be rerun in the future once resources become
 * available again. This is typically the case for device specific
 * resources that are consumed for IO. If the driver fails allocating these
 * resources, we know that inflight (or pending) IO will free these
 * resource upon completion.
 *
 * This is different from BLK_STS_RESOURCE in that it explicitly references
 * a device specific resource. For resources of wider scope, allocation
 * failure can happen without having pending IO. This means that we can&apos;t
 * rely on request completions freeing these resources, as IO may not be in
 * flight. Examples of that are kernel memory allocations, DMA mappings, or
 * any other system wide resources.
