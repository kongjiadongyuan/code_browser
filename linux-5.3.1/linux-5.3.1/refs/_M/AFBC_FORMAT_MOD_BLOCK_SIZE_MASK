 * AFBC superblock size
 *
 * Indicates the superblock size(s) used for the AFBC buffer. The buffer
 * size (in pixels) must be aligned to a multiple of the superblock size.
 * Four lowest significant bits(LSBs) are reserved for block size.
 *
 * Where one superblock size is specified, it applies to all planes of the
 * buffer (e.g. 16x16, 32x8). When multiple superblock sizes are specified,
 * the first applies to the Luma plane and the second applies to the Chroma
 * plane(s). e.g. (32x8_64x4 means 32x8 Luma, with 64x4 Chroma).
 * Multiple superblock sizes are only valid for multi-plane YCbCr formats.
