 * AFBC sparse layout
 *
 * This flag indicates that the payload of each superblock must be stored at a
 * predefined position relative to the other superblocks in the same AFBC
 * buffer. This order is the same order used by the header buffer. In this mode
 * each superblock is given the same amount of space as an uncompressed
 * superblock of the particular format would require, rounding up to the next
 * multiple of 128 bytes in size.
