 * request_key_net - Request a key for a net namespace and wait for construction
 * @type: Type of key.
 * @description: The searchable description of the key.
 * @net: The network namespace that is the key&apos;s domain of operation.
 * @callout_info: The data to pass to the instantiation upcall (or NULL).
 *
 * As for request_key() except that it does not add the returned key to a
 * keyring if found, new keys are always allocated in the user&apos;s quota, the
 * callout_info must be a NUL-terminated string and no auxiliary data can be
 * passed.  Only keys that operate the specified network namespace are used.
 *
 * Furthermore, it then works as wait_for_key_construction() to wait for the
 * completion of keys undergoing construction with a non-interruptible wait.
