 * member_address_is_nonnull - check whether the member address is not NULL
 * @ptr:	the object pointer (struct type * that contains the llist_node)
 * @member:	the name of the llist_node within the struct.
 *
 * This macro is conceptually the same as
 *	&amp;ptr-&gt;member != NULL
 * but it works around the fact that compilers can decide that taking a member
 * address is never a NULL pointer.
 *
 * Real objects that start at a high address and have a member at NULL are
 * unlikely to exist, but such pointers may be returned e.g. by the
 * container_of() macro.
