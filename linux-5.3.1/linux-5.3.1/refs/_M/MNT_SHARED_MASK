 * MNT_SHARED_MASK is the set of flags that should be cleared when a
 * mount becomes shared.  Currently, this is only the flag that says a
 * mount cannot be bind mounted, since this is how we create a mount
 * that shares events with another mount.  If you add a new MNT_*
 * flag, consider how it interacts with shared mounts.
