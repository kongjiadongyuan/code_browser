<doc f='linux-5.3.1/include/uapi/drm/drm_fourcc.h' l='616'>/* Broadcom UIF format
 *
 * This is the common format for the current Broadcom multimedia
 * blocks, including V3D 3.x and newer, newer video codecs, and
 * displays.
 *
 * The image consists of utiles (64b blocks), UIF blocks (2x2 utiles),
 * and macroblocks (4x4 UIF blocks).  Those 4x4 UIF block groups are
 * stored in columns, with padding between the columns to ensure that
 * moving from one column to the next doesn&apos;t hit the same SDRAM page
 * bank.
 *
 * To calculate the padding, it is assumed that each hardware block
 * and the software driving it knows the platform&apos;s SDRAM page size,
 * number of banks, and XOR address, and that it&apos;s identical between
 * all blocks using the format.  This tiling modifier will use XOR as
 * necessary to reduce the padding.  If a hardware block can&apos;t do XOR,
 * the assumption is that a no-XOR tiling modifier will be created.
