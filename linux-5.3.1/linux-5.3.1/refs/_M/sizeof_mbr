 * Deal with bootloaders which fail to initialize unknown fields in
 * boot_params to zero.  The list fields in this list are taken from
 * analysis of kexec-tools; if other broken bootloaders initialize a
 * different set of fields we will need to figure out how to disambiguate.
 *
 * Note: efi_info is commonly left uninitialized, but that field has a
 * private magic, so it is better to leave it unchanged.
