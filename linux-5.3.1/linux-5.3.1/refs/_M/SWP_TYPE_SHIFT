 * swapcache pages are stored in the swapper_space radix tree.  We want to
 * get good packing density in that tree, so the index should be dense in
 * the low-order bits.
 *
 * We arrange the `type&apos; and `offset&apos; fields so that `type&apos; is at the seven
 * high-order bits of the swp_entry_t and `offset&apos; is right-aligned in the
 * remaining bits.  Although `type&apos; itself needs only five bits, we allow for
 * shmem/tmpfs to shift it all up a further two bits: see swp_to_radix_entry().
 *
 * swp_entry_t&apos;s are *never* stored anywhere in their arch-dependent format.
