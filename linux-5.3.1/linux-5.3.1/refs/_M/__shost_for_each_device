 * __shost_for_each_device - iterate over all devices of a host (UNLOCKED)
 * @sdev: the &amp;struct scsi_device to use as a cursor
 * @shost: the &amp;struct scsi_host to iterate over
 *
 * Iterator that returns each device attached to @shost.  It does _not_
 * take a reference on the scsi_device, so the whole loop must be
 * protected by shost-&gt;host_lock.
 *
 * Note: The only reason to use this is because you need to access the
 * device list in interrupt context.  Otherwise you really want to use
 * shost_for_each_device instead.
