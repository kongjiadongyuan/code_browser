 * wait_event_killable - sleep until a condition gets true
 * @wq_head: the waitqueue to wait on
 * @condition: a C expression for the event to wait for
 *
 * The process is put to sleep (TASK_KILLABLE) until the
 * @condition evaluates to true or a signal is received.
 * The @condition is checked each time the waitqueue @wq_head is woken up.
 *
 * wake_up() has to be called after changing any variable that could
 * change the result of the wait condition.
 *
 * The function will return -ERESTARTSYS if it was interrupted by a
 * signal and 0 if @condition evaluated to true.
