 * Once upon a time we supposed that writes through the GGTT would be
 * immediately in physical memory (once flushed out of the CPU path). However,
 * on a few different processors and chipsets, this is not necessarily the case
 * as the writes appear to be buffered internally. Thus a read of the backing
 * storage (physical memory) via a different path (with different physical tags
 * to the indirect write via the GGTT) will see stale values from before
 * the GGTT write. Inside the kernel, we can for the most part keep track of
 * the different read/write domains in use (e.g. set-domain), but the assumption
 * of coherency is baked into the ABI, hence reporting its true state in this
 * parameter.
 *
 * Reports true when writes via mmap_gtt are immediately visible following an
 * lfence to flush the WCB.
 *
 * Reports false when writes via mmap_gtt are indeterminately delayed in an in
 * internal buffer and are _not_ immediately visible to third parties accessing
 * directly via mmap_cpu/mmap_wc. Use of mmap_gtt as part of an IPC
 * communications channel when reporting false is strongly disadvised.
