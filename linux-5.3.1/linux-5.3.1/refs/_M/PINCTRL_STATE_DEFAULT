 * @PINCTRL_STATE_DEFAULT: the state the pinctrl handle shall be put
 *	into as default, usually this means the pins are up and ready to
 *	be used by the device driver. This state is commonly used by
 *	hogs to configure muxing and pins at boot, and also as a state
 *	to go into when returning from sleep and idle in
 *	.pm_runtime_resume() or ordinary .resume() for example.
 * @PINCTRL_STATE_INIT: normally the pinctrl will be set to &quot;default&quot;
 *	before the driver&apos;s probe() function is called.  There are some
 *	drivers where that is not appropriate becausing doing so would
 *	glitch the pins.  In those cases you can add an &quot;init&quot; pinctrl
 *	which is the state of the pins before drive probe.  After probe
 *	if the pins are still in &quot;init&quot; state they&apos;ll be moved to
 *	&quot;default&quot;.
 * @PINCTRL_STATE_IDLE: the state the pinctrl handle shall be put into
 *	when the pins are idle. This is a state where the system is relaxed
 *	but not fully sleeping - some power may be on but clocks gated for
 *	example. Could typically be set from a pm_runtime_suspend() or
 *	pm_runtime_idle() operation.
 * @PINCTRL_STATE_SLEEP: the state the pinctrl handle shall be put into
 *	when the pins are sleeping. This is a state where the system is in
 *	its lowest sleep state. Could typically be set from an
 *	ordinary .suspend() function.
