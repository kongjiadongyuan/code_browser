 * Intel sprite handling
 *
 * Color keying works with a min/mask/max tuple.  Both source and destination
 * color keying is allowed.
 *
 * Source keying:
 * Sprite pixels within the min &amp; max values, masked against the color channels
 * specified in the mask field, will be transparent.  All other pixels will
 * be displayed on top of the primary plane.  For RGB surfaces, only the min
 * and mask fields will be used; ranged compares are not allowed.
 *
 * Destination keying:
 * Primary plane pixels that match the min value, masked against the color
 * channels specified in the mask field, will be replaced by corresponding
 * pixels from the sprite plane.
 *
 * Note that source &amp; destination keying are exclusive; only one can be
 * active on a given plane.
