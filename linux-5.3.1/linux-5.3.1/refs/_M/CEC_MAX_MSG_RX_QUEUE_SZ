 * The minimum message length you can receive (excepting poll messages) is 2.
 * With a transfer rate of at most 36 bytes per second this makes 18 messages
 * per second worst case.
 *
 * We queue at most 3 seconds worth of received messages. The CEC specification
 * requires that messages are replied to within a second, so 3 seconds should
 * give more than enough margin. Since most messages are actually more than 2
 * bytes, this is in practice a lot more than 3 seconds.
