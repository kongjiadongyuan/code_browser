 * wait_event_freezable - sleep (or freeze) until a condition gets true
 * @wq_head: the waitqueue to wait on
 * @condition: a C expression for the event to wait for
 *
 * The process is put to sleep (TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE -- so as not to contribute
 * to system load) until the @condition evaluates to true. The
 * @condition is checked each time the waitqueue @wq_head is woken up.
 *
 * wake_up() has to be called after changing any variable that could
 * change the result of the wait condition.
