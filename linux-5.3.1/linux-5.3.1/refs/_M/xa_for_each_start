 * xa_for_each_start() - Iterate over a portion of an XArray.
 * @xa: XArray.
 * @index: Index of @entry.
 * @entry: Entry retrieved from array.
 * @start: First index to retrieve from array.
 *
 * During the iteration, @entry will have the value of the entry stored
 * in @xa at @index.  You may modify @index during the iteration if you
 * want to skip or reprocess indices.  It is safe to modify the array
 * during the iteration.  At the end of the iteration, @entry will be set
 * to NULL and @index will have a value less than or equal to max.
 *
 * xa_for_each_start() is O(n.log(n)) while xas_for_each() is O(n).  You have
 * to handle your own locking with xas_for_each(), and if you have to unlock
 * after each iteration, it will also end up being O(n.log(n)).
 * xa_for_each_start() will spin if it hits a retry entry; if you intend to
 * see retry entries, you should use the xas_for_each() iterator instead.
 * The xas_for_each() iterator will expand into more inline code than
 * xa_for_each_start().
 *
 * Context: Any context.  Takes and releases the RCU lock.
