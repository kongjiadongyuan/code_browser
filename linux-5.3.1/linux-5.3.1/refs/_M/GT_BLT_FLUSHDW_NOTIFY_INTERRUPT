<doc f='linux-5.3.1/drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_reg.h' l='2986'>/* On modern GEN architectures interrupt control consists of two sets
 * of registers. The first set pertains to the ring generating the
 * interrupt. The second control is for the functional block generating the
 * interrupt. These are PM, GT, DE, etc.
 *
 * Luckily *knocks on wood* all the ring interrupt bits match up with the
 * GT interrupt bits, so we don&apos;t need to duplicate the defines.
 *
 * These defines should cover us well from SNB-&gt;HSW with minor exceptions
 * it can also work on ILK.
