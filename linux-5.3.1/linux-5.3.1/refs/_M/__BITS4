 *
 * UWtype -- An unsigned type, default type for operations (typically a &quot;word&quot;)
 * UHWtype -- An unsigned type, at least half the size of UWtype.
 * UDWtype -- An unsigned type, at least twice as large a UWtype
 * W_TYPE_SIZE -- size in bits of UWtype
 *
 * SItype, USItype -- Signed and unsigned 32 bit types.
 * DItype, UDItype -- Signed and unsigned 64 bit types.
 *
 * On a 32 bit machine UWtype should typically be USItype;
 * on a 64 bit machine, UWtype should typically be UDItype.
