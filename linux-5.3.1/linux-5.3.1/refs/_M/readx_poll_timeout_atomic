 * readx_poll_timeout_atomic - Periodically poll an address until a condition is met or a timeout occurs
 * @op: accessor function (takes @addr as its only argument)
 * @addr: Address to poll
 * @val: Variable to read the value into
 * @cond: Break condition (usually involving @val)
 * @delay_us: Time to udelay between reads in us (0 tight-loops).  Should
 *            be less than ~10us since udelay is used (see
 *            Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst).
 * @timeout_us: Timeout in us, 0 means never timeout
 *
 * Returns 0 on success and -ETIMEDOUT upon a timeout. In either
 * case, the last read value at @addr is stored in @val.
 *
 * When available, you&apos;ll probably want to use one of the specialized
 * macros defined below rather than this macro directly.
