 * The bottom two bits of the slot determine how the remaining bits in the
 * slot are interpreted:
 *
 * 00 - data pointer
 * 10 - internal entry
 * x1 - value entry
 *
 * The internal entry may be a pointer to the next level in the tree, a
 * sibling entry, or an indicator that the entry in this slot has been moved
 * to another location in the tree and the lookup should be restarted.  While
 * NULL fits the &apos;data pointer&apos; pattern, it means that there is no entry in
 * the tree for this index (no matter what level of the tree it is found at).
 * This means that storing a NULL entry in the tree is the same as deleting
 * the entry from the tree.
