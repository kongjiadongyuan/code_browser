 * wait_event_interruptible_hrtimeout - sleep until a condition gets true or a timeout elapses
 * @wq: the waitqueue to wait on
 * @condition: a C expression for the event to wait for
 * @timeout: timeout, as a ktime_t
 *
 * The process is put to sleep (TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) until the
 * @condition evaluates to true or a signal is received.
 * The @condition is checked each time the waitqueue @wq is woken up.
 *
 * wake_up() has to be called after changing any variable that could
 * change the result of the wait condition.
 *
 * The function returns 0 if @condition became true, -ERESTARTSYS if it was
 * interrupted by a signal, or -ETIME if the timeout elapsed.
