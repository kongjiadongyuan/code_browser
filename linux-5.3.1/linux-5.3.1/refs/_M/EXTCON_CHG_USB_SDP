 * Charging external connector
 *
 * When one SDP charger connector was reported, we should also report
 * the USB connector, which means EXTCON_CHG_USB_SDP should always
 * appear together with EXTCON_USB. The same as ACA charger connector,
 * EXTCON_CHG_USB_ACA would normally appear with EXTCON_USB_HOST.
 *
 * The EXTCON_CHG_USB_SLOW connector can provide at least 500mA of
 * current at 5V. The EXTCON_CHG_USB_FAST connector can provide at
 * least 1A of current at 5V.
