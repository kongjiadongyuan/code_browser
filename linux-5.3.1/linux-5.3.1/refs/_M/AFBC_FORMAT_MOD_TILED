 * AFBC tiled layout
 *
 * The tiled layout groups superblocks in 8x8 or 4x4 tiles, where all
 * superblocks inside a tile are stored together in memory. 8x8 tiles are used
 * for pixel formats up to and including 32 bpp while 4x4 tiles are used for
 * larger bpp formats. The order between the tiles is scan line.
 * When the tiled layout is used, the buffer size (in pixels) must be aligned
 * to the tile size.
