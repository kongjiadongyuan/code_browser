 * Allwinner tiled modifier
 *
 * This tiling mode is implemented by the VPU found on all Allwinner platforms,
 * codenamed sunxi. It is associated with a YUV format that uses either 2 or 3
 * planes.
 *
 * With this tiling, the luminance samples are disposed in tiles representing
 * 32x32 pixels and the chrominance samples in tiles representing 32x64 pixels.
 * The pixel order in each tile is linear and the tiles are disposed linearly,
 * both in row-major order.
