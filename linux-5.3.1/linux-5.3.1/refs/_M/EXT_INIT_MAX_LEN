 * EXT_INIT_MAX_LEN is the maximum number of blocks we can have in an
 * initialized extent. This is 2^15 and not (2^16 - 1), since we use the
 * MSB of ee_len field in the extent datastructure to signify if this
 * particular extent is an initialized extent or an unwritten (i.e.
 * preallocated).
 * EXT_UNWRITTEN_MAX_LEN is the maximum number of blocks we can have in an
 * unwritten extent.
 * If ee_len is &lt;= 0x8000, it is an initialized extent. Otherwise, it is an
 * unwritten one. In other words, if MSB of ee_len is set, it is an
 * unwritten extent with only one special scenario when ee_len = 0x8000.
 * In this case we can not have an unwritten extent of zero length and
 * thus we make it as a special case of initialized extent with 0x8000 length.
 * This way we get better extent-to-group alignment for initialized extents.
 * Hence, the maximum number of blocks we can have in an *initialized*
 * extent is 2^15 (32768) and in an *unwritten* extent is 2^15-1 (32767).
