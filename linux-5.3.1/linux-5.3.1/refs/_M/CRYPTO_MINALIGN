 * The macro CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR (along with the void * type in the actual
 * declaration) is used to ensure that the crypto_tfm context structure is
 * aligned correctly for the given architecture so that there are no alignment
 * faults for C data types.  In particular, this is required on platforms such
 * as arm where pointers are 32-bit aligned but there are data types such as
 * u64 which require 64-bit alignment.
