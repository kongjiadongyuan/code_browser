 * For regulatory extension stuff see IEEE 802.11-2007
 * Annex I (page 1141) and Annex J (page 1147). Also
 * review 7.3.2.9.
 *
 * When dot11RegulatoryClassesRequired is true and the
 * first_channel/reg_extension_id is &gt;= 201 then the IE
 * compromises of the &apos;ext&apos; struct represented below:
 *
 *  - Regulatory extension ID - when generating IE this just needs
 *    to be monotonically increasing for each triplet passed in
 *    the IE
 *  - Regulatory class - index into set of rules
 *  - Coverage class - index into air propagation time (Table 7-27),
 *    in microseconds, you can compute the air propagation time from
 *    the index by multiplying by 3, so index 10 yields a propagation
 *    of 10 us. Valid values are 0-31, values 32-255 are not defined
 *    yet. A value of 0 inicates air propagation of &lt;= 1 us.
 *
 *  See also Table I.2 for Emission limit sets and table
 *  I.3 for Behavior limit sets. Table J.1 indicates how to map
 *  a reg_class to an emission limit set and behavior limit set.
