 * wait_event_idle_exclusive - wait for a condition with contributing to system load
 * @wq_head: the waitqueue to wait on
 * @condition: a C expression for the event to wait for

 * The process is put to sleep (TASK_IDLE) until the
 * @condition evaluates to true.
 * The @condition is checked each time the waitqueue @wq_head is woken up.
 *
 * The process is put on the wait queue with an WQ_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE flag
 * set thus if other processes wait on the same list, when this
 * process is woken further processes are not considered.
 *
 * wake_up() has to be called after changing any variable that could
 * change the result of the wait condition.
