 * kfifo_dma_out_prepare - setup a scatterlist for DMA output
 * @fifo: address of the fifo to be used
 * @sgl: pointer to the scatterlist array
 * @nents: number of entries in the scatterlist array
 * @len: number of elements to transfer
 *
 * This macro fills a scatterlist for DMA output which at most @len bytes
 * to transfer.
 * It returns the number entries in the scatterlist array.
 * A zero means there is no space available and the scatterlist is not filled.
 *
 * Note that with only one concurrent reader and one concurrent
 * writer, you don&apos;t need extra locking to use these macros.
