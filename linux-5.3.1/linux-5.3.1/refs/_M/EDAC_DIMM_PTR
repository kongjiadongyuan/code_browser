 * EDAC_DIMM_PTR - Macro responsible to get a pointer inside a pointer array
 *		   for the element given by [layer0,layer1,layer2] position
 *
 * @layers:	a struct edac_mc_layer array, describing how many elements
 *		were allocated for each layer
 * @var:	name of the var where we want to get the pointer
 *		(like mci-&gt;dimms)
 * @nlayers:	Number of layers at the @layers array
 * @layer0:	layer0 position
 * @layer1:	layer1 position. Unused if n_layers &lt; 2
 * @layer2:	layer2 position. Unused if n_layers &lt; 3
 *
 * For 1 layer, this macro returns &quot;var[layer0]&quot;;
 *
 * For 2 layers, this macro is similar to allocate a bi-dimensional array
 * and to return &quot;var[layer0][layer1]&quot;;
 *
 * For 3 layers, this macro is similar to allocate a tri-dimensional array
 * and to return &quot;var[layer0][layer1][layer2]&quot;;
