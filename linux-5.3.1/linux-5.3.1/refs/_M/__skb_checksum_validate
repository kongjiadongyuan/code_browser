 * want to calculate the pseudo header which is an input function if necessary.
 * First we try to validate without any computation (checksum unnecessary) and
 * then calculate based on checksum complete calling the function to compute
 * pseudo header.

 * Return values:
 *   0: checksum is validated or try to in skb_checksum_complete
 *   non-zero: value of invalid checksum
