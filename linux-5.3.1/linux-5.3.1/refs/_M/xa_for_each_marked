 * xa_for_each_marked() - Iterate over marked entries in an XArray.
 * @xa: XArray.
 * @index: Index of @entry.
 * @entry: Entry retrieved from array.
 * @filter: Selection criterion.
 *
 * During the iteration, @entry will have the value of the entry stored
 * in @xa at @index.  The iteration will skip all entries in the array
 * which do not match @filter.  You may modify @index during the iteration
 * if you want to skip or reprocess indices.  It is safe to modify the array
 * during the iteration.  At the end of the iteration, @entry will be set to
 * NULL and @index will have a value less than or equal to max.
 *
 * xa_for_each_marked() is O(n.log(n)) while xas_for_each_marked() is O(n).
 * You have to handle your own locking with xas_for_each(), and if you have
 * to unlock after each iteration, it will also end up being O(n.log(n)).
 * xa_for_each_marked() will spin if it hits a retry entry; if you intend to
 * see retry entries, you should use the xas_for_each_marked() iterator
 * instead.  The xas_for_each_marked() iterator will expand into more inline
 * code than xa_for_each_marked().
 *
 * Context: Any context.  Takes and releases the RCU lock.
