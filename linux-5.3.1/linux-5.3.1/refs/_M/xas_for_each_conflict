 * xas_for_each_conflict() - Iterate over a range of an XArray.
 * @xas: XArray operation state.
 * @entry: Entry retrieved from the array.
 *
 * The loop body will be executed for each entry in the XArray that lies
 * within the range specified by @xas.  If the loop completes successfully,
 * any entries that lie in this range will be replaced by @entry.  The caller
 * may break out of the loop; if they do so, the contents of the XArray will
 * be unchanged.  The operation may fail due to an out of memory condition.
 * The caller may also call xa_set_err() to exit the loop while setting an
 * error to record the reason.
