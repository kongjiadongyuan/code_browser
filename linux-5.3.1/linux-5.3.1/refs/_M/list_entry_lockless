 * list_entry_lockless - get the struct for this entry
 * @ptr:        the &amp;struct list_head pointer.
 * @type:       the type of the struct this is embedded in.
 * @member:     the name of the list_head within the struct.
 *
 * This primitive may safely run concurrently with the _rcu
 * list-mutation primitives such as list_add_rcu(), but requires some
 * implicit RCU read-side guarding.  One example is running within a special
 * exception-time environment where preemption is disabled and where lockdep
 * cannot be invoked.  Another example is when items are added to the list,
 * but never deleted.
