 * kfifo_reset_out - skip fifo content
 * @fifo: address of the fifo to be used
 *
 * Note: The usage of kfifo_reset_out() is safe until it will be only called
 * from the reader thread and there is only one concurrent reader. Otherwise
 * it is dangerous and must be handled in the same way as kfifo_reset().
