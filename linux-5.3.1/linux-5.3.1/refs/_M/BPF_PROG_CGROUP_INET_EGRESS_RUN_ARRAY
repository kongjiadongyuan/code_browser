<doc f='linux-5.3.1/include/linux/bpf.h' l='558'>/* To be used by __cgroup_bpf_run_filter_skb for EGRESS BPF progs
 * so BPF programs can request cwr for TCP packets.
 *
 * Current cgroup skb programs can only return 0 or 1 (0 to drop the
 * packet. This macro changes the behavior so the low order bit
 * indicates whether the packet should be dropped (0) or not (1)
 * and the next bit is a congestion notification bit. This could be
 * used by TCP to call tcp_enter_cwr()
 *
 * Hence, new allowed return values of CGROUP EGRESS BPF programs are:
 *   0: drop packet
 *   1: keep packet
 *   2: drop packet and cn
 *   3: keep packet and cn
 *
 * This macro then converts it to one of the NET_XMIT or an error
 * code that is then interpreted as drop packet (and no cn):
 *   0: NET_XMIT_SUCCESS  skb should be transmitted
 *   1: NET_XMIT_DROP     skb should be dropped and cn
 *   2: NET_XMIT_CN       skb should be transmitted and cn
 *   3: -EPERM            skb should be dropped
