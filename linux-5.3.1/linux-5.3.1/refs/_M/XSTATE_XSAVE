 * If XSAVES is enabled, it replaces XSAVEOPT because it supports a compact
 * format and supervisor states in addition to modified optimization in
 * XSAVEOPT.
 *
 * Otherwise, if XSAVEOPT is enabled, XSAVEOPT replaces XSAVE because XSAVEOPT
 * supports modified optimization which is not supported by XSAVE.
 *
 * We use XSAVE as a fallback.
 *
 * The 661 label is defined in the ALTERNATIVE* macros as the address of the
 * original instruction which gets replaced. We need to use it here as the
 * address of the instruction where we might get an exception at.
