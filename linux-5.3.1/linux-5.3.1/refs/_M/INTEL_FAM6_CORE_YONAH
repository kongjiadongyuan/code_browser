 * &quot;Big Core&quot; Processors (Branded as Core, Xeon, etc...)
 *
 * The &quot;_X&quot; parts are generally the EP and EX Xeons, or the
 * &quot;Extreme&quot; ones, like Broadwell-E, or Atom microserver.
 *
 * While adding a new CPUID for a new microarchitecture, add a new
 * group to keep logically sorted out in chronological order. Within
 * that group keep the CPUID for the variants sorted by model number.
 *
 * The defined symbol names have the following form:
 *	INTEL_FAM6{OPTFAMILY}_{MICROARCH}{OPTDIFF}
 * where:
 * OPTFAMILY	Describes the family of CPUs that this belongs to. Default
 *		is assumed to be &quot;_CORE&quot; (and should be omitted). Other values
 *		currently in use are _ATOM and _XEON_PHI
 * MICROARCH	Is the code name for the micro-architecture for this core.
 *		N.B. Not the platform name.
 * OPTDIFF	If needed, a short string to differentiate by market segment.
 *		Exact strings here will vary over time. _DESKTOP, _MOBILE, and
 *		_X (short for Xeon server) should be used when they are
 *		appropriate.
 *
 * The #define line may optionally include a comment including platform names.
