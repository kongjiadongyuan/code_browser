 * Notes on SNB/IVB/VLV context size:
 * - Power context is saved elsewhere (LLC or stolen)
 * - Ring/execlist context is saved on SNB, not on IVB
 * - Extended context size already includes render context size
 * - We always need to follow the extended context size.
 *   SNB BSpec has comments indicating that we should use the
 *   render context size instead if execlists are disabled, but
 *   based on empirical testing that&apos;s just nonsense.
 * - Pipelined/VF state is saved on SNB/IVB respectively
 * - GT1 size just indicates how much of render context
 *   doesn&apos;t need saving on GT1
