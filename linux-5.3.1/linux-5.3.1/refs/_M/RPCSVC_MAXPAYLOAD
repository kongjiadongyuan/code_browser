 * Maximum payload size supported by a kernel RPC server.
 * This is use to determine the max number of pages nfsd is
 * willing to return in a single READ operation.
 *
 * These happen to all be powers of 2, which is not strictly
 * necessary but helps enforce the real limitation, which is
 * that they should be multiples of PAGE_SIZE.
 *
 * For UDP transports, a block plus NFS,RPC, and UDP headers
 * has to fit into the IP datagram limit of 64K.  The largest
 * feasible number for all known page sizes is probably 48K,
 * but we choose 32K here.  This is the same as the historical
 * Linux limit; someone who cares more about NFS/UDP performance
 * can test a larger number.
 *
 * For TCP transports we have more freedom.  A size of 1MB is
 * chosen to match the client limit.  Other OSes are known to
 * have larger limits, but those numbers are probably beyond
 * the point of diminishing returns.
