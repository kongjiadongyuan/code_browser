 * Where the bus hardware includes a privilege level as part of its access type
 * markings, and certain devices are capable of issuing transactions marked as
 * either &apos;supervisor&apos; or &apos;user&apos;, the IOMMU_PRIV flag requests that the other
 * given permission flags only apply to accesses at the higher privilege level,
 * and that unprivileged transactions should have as little access as possible.
 * This would usually imply the same permissions as kernel mappings on the CPU,
 * if the IOMMU page table format is equivalent.
