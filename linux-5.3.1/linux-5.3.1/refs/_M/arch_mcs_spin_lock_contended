 * Using smp_cond_load_acquire() provides the acquire semantics
 * required so that subsequent operations happen after the
 * lock is acquired. Additionally, some architectures such as
 * ARM64 would like to do spin-waiting instead of purely
 * spinning, and smp_cond_load_acquire() provides that behavior.
