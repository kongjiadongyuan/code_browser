 * Arm Framebuffer Compression (AFBC) modifiers
 *
 * AFBC is a proprietary lossless image compression protocol and format.
 * It provides fine-grained random access and minimizes the amount of data
 * transferred between IP blocks.
 *
 * AFBC has several features which may be supported and/or used, which are
 * represented using bits in the modifier. Not all combinations are valid,
 * and different devices or use-cases may support different combinations.
 *
 * Further information on the use of AFBC modifiers can be found in
 * Documentation/gpu/afbc.rst
