 * DOC: idr sync
 * idr synchronization (stolen from radix-tree.h)
 *
 * idr_find() is able to be called locklessly, using RCU. The caller must
 * ensure calls to this function are made within rcu_read_lock() regions.
 * Other readers (lock-free or otherwise) and modifications may be running
 * concurrently.
 *
 * It is still required that the caller manage the synchronization and
 * lifetimes of the items. So if RCU lock-free lookups are used, typically
 * this would mean that the items have their own locks, or are amenable to
 * lock-free access; and that the items are freed by RCU (or only freed after
 * having been deleted from the idr tree *and* a synchronize_rcu() grace
 * period).
