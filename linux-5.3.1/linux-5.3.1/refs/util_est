 * struct util_est - Estimation utilization of FAIR tasks
 * @enqueued: instantaneous estimated utilization of a task/cpu
 * @ewma:     the Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)
 *            utilization of a task
 *
 * Support data structure to track an Exponential Weighted Moving Average
 * (EWMA) of a FAIR task&apos;s utilization. New samples are added to the moving
 * average each time a task completes an activation. Sample&apos;s weight is chosen
 * so that the EWMA will be relatively insensitive to transient changes to the
 * task&apos;s workload.
 *
 * The enqueued attribute has a slightly different meaning for tasks and cpus:
 * - task:   the task&apos;s util_avg at last task dequeue time
 * - cfs_rq: the sum of util_est.enqueued for each RUNNABLE task on that CPU
 * Thus, the util_est.enqueued of a task represents the contribution on the
 * estimated utilization of the CPU where that task is currently enqueued.
 *
 * Only for tasks we track a moving average of the past instantaneous
 * estimated utilization. This allows to absorb sporadic drops in utilization
 * of an otherwise almost periodic task.
