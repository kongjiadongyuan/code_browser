 * hwsp_seqno - the current breadcrumb value in the HW status page
 * @rq: the request, to chase the relevant HW status page
 *
 * The emphasis in naming here is that hwsp_seqno() is not a property of the
 * request, but an indication of the current HW state (associated with this
 * request). Its value will change as the GPU executes more requests.
 *
 * Returns the current breadcrumb value in the associated HW status page (or
 * the local timeline&apos;s equivalent) for this request. The request itself
 * has the associated breadcrumb value of rq-&gt;fence.seqno, when the HW
 * status page has that breadcrumb or later, this request is complete.
