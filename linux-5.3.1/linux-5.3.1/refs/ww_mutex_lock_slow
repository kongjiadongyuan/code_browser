 * ww_mutex_lock_slow - slowpath acquiring of the w/w mutex
 * @lock: the mutex to be acquired
 * @ctx: w/w acquire context
 *
 * Acquires a w/w mutex with the given context after a die case. This function
 * will sleep until the lock becomes available.
 *
 * The caller must have released all w/w mutexes already acquired with the
 * context and then call this function on the contended lock.
 *
 * Afterwards the caller may continue to (re)acquire the other w/w mutexes it
 * needs with ww_mutex_lock. Note that the -EALREADY return code from
 * ww_mutex_lock can be used to avoid locking this contended mutex twice.
 *
 * It is forbidden to call this function with any other w/w mutexes associated
 * with the context held. It is forbidden to call this on anything else than the
 * contending mutex.
 *
 * Note that the slowpath lock acquiring can also be done by calling
 * ww_mutex_lock directly. This function here is simply to help w/w mutex
 * locking code readability by clearly denoting the slowpath.
