 * Consider releasing a page for the vmscan algorithm, on behalf of the netfs&apos;s
 * releasepage() call.  A storage request on the page may cancelled if it is
 * not currently being processed.
 *
 * The function returns true if the page no longer has a storage request on it,
 * and false if a storage request is left in place.  If true is returned, the
 * page will have been passed to fscache_uncache_page().  If false is returned
 * the page cannot be freed yet.
