 * xa_reserve() - Reserve this index in the XArray.
 * @xa: XArray.
 * @index: Index into array.
 * @gfp: Memory allocation flags.
 *
 * Ensures there is somewhere to store an entry at @index in the array.
 * If there is already something stored at @index, this function does
 * nothing.  If there was nothing there, the entry is marked as reserved.
 * Loading from a reserved entry returns a %NULL pointer.
 *
 * If you do not use the entry that you have reserved, call xa_release()
 * or xa_erase() to free any unnecessary memory.
 *
 * Context: Any context.  Takes and releases the xa_lock.
 * May sleep if the @gfp flags permit.
 * Return: 0 if the reservation succeeded or -ENOMEM if it failed.
