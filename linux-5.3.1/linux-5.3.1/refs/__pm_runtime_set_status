 * __pm_runtime_set_status - Set runtime PM status of a device.
 * @dev: Device to handle.
 * @status: New runtime PM status of the device.
 *
 * If runtime PM of the device is disabled or its power.runtime_error field is
 * different from zero, the status may be changed either to RPM_ACTIVE, or to
 * RPM_SUSPENDED, as long as that reflects the actual state of the device.
 * However, if the device has a parent and the parent is not active, and the
 * parent&apos;s power.ignore_children flag is unset, the device&apos;s status cannot be
 * set to RPM_ACTIVE, so -EBUSY is returned in that case.
 *
 * If successful, __pm_runtime_set_status() clears the power.runtime_error field
 * and the device parent&apos;s counter of unsuspended children is modified to
 * reflect the new status.  If the new status is RPM_SUSPENDED, an idle
 * notification request for the parent is submitted.
 *
 * If @dev has any suppliers (as reflected by device links to them), and @status
 * is RPM_ACTIVE, they will be activated upfront and if the activation of one
 * of them fails, the status of @dev will be changed to RPM_SUSPENDED (instead
 * of the @status value) and the suppliers will be deacticated on exit.  The
 * error returned by the failing supplier activation will be returned in that
 * case.
