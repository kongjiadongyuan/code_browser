 * kick_all_cpus_sync - Force all cpus out of idle
 *
 * Used to synchronize the update of pm_idle function pointer. It&apos;s
 * called after the pointer is updated and returns after the dummy
 * callback function has been executed on all cpus. The execution of
 * the function can only happen on the remote cpus after they have
 * left the idle function which had been called via pm_idle function
 * pointer. So it&apos;s guaranteed that nothing uses the previous pointer
 * anymore.
