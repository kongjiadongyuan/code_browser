 * restrict_link_by_key_or_keyring - Restrict additions to a ring of public
 * keys using the restrict_key information stored in the ring.
 * @dest_keyring: Keyring being linked to.
 * @type: The type of key being added.
 * @payload: The payload of the new key.
 * @trusted: A key or ring of keys that can be used to vouch for the new cert.
 *
 * Check the new certificate only against the key or keys passed in the data
 * parameter. If one of those is the signing key and validates the new
 * certificate, then mark the new certificate as being ok to link.
 *
 * Returns 0 if the new certificate was accepted, -ENOKEY if we
 * couldn&apos;t find a matching parent certificate in the trusted list,
 * -EKEYREJECTED if the signature check fails, -ENOPKG if the signature uses
 * unsupported crypto, or some other error if there is a matching certificate
 * but the signature check cannot be performed.
