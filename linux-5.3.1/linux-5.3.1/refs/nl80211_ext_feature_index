 *	can request to use RRM (see %NL80211_ATTR_USE_RRM) with
 *	%NL80211_CMD_ASSOCIATE and %NL80211_CMD_CONNECT requests, which will set
 *	the ASSOC_REQ_USE_RRM flag in the association request even if
 *	NL80211_FEATURE_QUIET is not advertized.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_MU_MIMO_AIR_SNIFFER: This device supports MU-MIMO air
 *	sniffer which means that it can be configured to hear packets from
 *	certain groups which can be configured by the
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_MU_MIMO_GROUP_DATA attribute,

 *	%NL80211_ATTR_MU_MIMO_FOLLOW_MAC_ADDR attribute.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_SCAN_START_TIME: This driver includes the actual
 *	time the scan started in scan results event. The time is the TSF of
 *	the BSS that the interface that requested the scan is connected to
 *	(if available).
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_BSS_PARENT_TSF: Per BSS, this driver reports the
 *	time the last beacon/probe was received. The time is the TSF of the
 *	BSS that the interface that requested the scan is connected to
 *	(if available).
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_SET_SCAN_DWELL: This driver supports configuration of
 *	channel dwell time.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_BEACON_RATE_LEGACY: Driver supports beacon rate
 *	configuration (AP/mesh), supporting a legacy (non HT/VHT) rate.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_BEACON_RATE_HT: Driver supports beacon rate
 *	configuration (AP/mesh) with HT rates.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_BEACON_RATE_VHT: Driver supports beacon rate
 *	configuration (AP/mesh) with VHT rates.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_FILS_STA: This driver supports Fast Initial Link Setup
 *	with user space SME (NL80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE) in station mode.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_MGMT_TX_RANDOM_TA: This driver supports randomized TA
 *	in @NL80211_CMD_FRAME while not associated.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_MGMT_TX_RANDOM_TA_CONNECTED: This driver supports
 *	randomized TA in @NL80211_CMD_FRAME while associated.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_SCHED_SCAN_RELATIVE_RSSI: The driver supports sched_scan
 *	for reporting BSSs with better RSSI than the current connected BSS
 *	(%NL80211_ATTR_SCHED_SCAN_RELATIVE_RSSI).
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_CQM_RSSI_LIST: With this driver the
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_CQM_RSSI_THOLD attribute accepts a list of zero or more
 *	RSSI threshold values to monitor rather than exactly one threshold.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_FILS_SK_OFFLOAD: Driver SME supports FILS shared key
 *	authentication with %NL80211_CMD_CONNECT.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_4WAY_HANDSHAKE_STA_PSK: Device wants to do 4-way
 *	handshake with PSK in station mode (PSK is passed as part of the connect
 *	and associate commands), doing it in the host might not be supported.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_4WAY_HANDSHAKE_STA_1X: Device wants to do doing 4-way
 *	handshake with 802.1X in station mode (will pass EAP frames to the host
 *	and accept the set_pmk/del_pmk commands), doing it in the host might not
 *	be supported.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_FILS_MAX_CHANNEL_TIME: Driver is capable of overriding
 *	the max channel attribute in the FILS request params IE with the
 *	actual dwell time.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_ACCEPT_BCAST_PROBE_RESP: Driver accepts broadcast probe
 *	response
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_OCE_PROBE_REQ_HIGH_TX_RATE: Driver supports sending
 *	the first probe request in each channel at rate of at least 5.5Mbps.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_OCE_PROBE_REQ_DEFERRAL_SUPPRESSION: Driver supports
 *	probe request tx deferral and suppression
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_MFP_OPTIONAL: Driver supports the %NL80211_MFP_OPTIONAL
 *	value in %NL80211_ATTR_USE_MFP.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_LOW_SPAN_SCAN: Driver supports low span scan.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_LOW_POWER_SCAN: Driver supports low power scan.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_HIGH_ACCURACY_SCAN: Driver supports high accuracy scan.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_DFS_OFFLOAD: HW/driver will offload DFS actions.
 *	Device or driver will do all DFS-related actions by itself,
 *	informing user-space about CAC progress, radar detection event,
 *	channel change triggered by radar detection event.
 *	No need to start CAC from user-space, no need to react to
 *	&quot;radar detected&quot; event.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_CONTROL_PORT_OVER_NL80211: Driver supports sending and
 *	receiving control port frames over nl80211 instead of the netdevice.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_ACK_SIGNAL_SUPPORT: This driver/device supports
 *	(average) ACK signal strength reporting.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_TXQS: Driver supports FQ-CoDel-enabled intermediate
 *      TXQs.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_SCAN_RANDOM_SN: Driver/device supports randomizing the
 *	SN in probe request frames if requested by %NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_RANDOM_SN.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_SCAN_MIN_PREQ_CONTENT: Driver/device can omit all data
 *	except for supported rates from the probe request content if requested
 *	by the %NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_MIN_PREQ_CONTENT flag.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_ENABLE_FTM_RESPONDER: Driver supports enabling fine
 *	timing measurement responder role.
 *
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_CAN_REPLACE_PTK0: Driver/device confirm that they are
 *      able to rekey an in-use key correctly. Userspace must not rekey PTK keys
 *      if this flag is not set. Ignoring this can leak clear text packets and/or
 *      freeze the connection.
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_EXT_KEY_ID: Driver supports &quot;Extended Key ID for
 *      Individually Addressed Frames&quot; from IEEE802.11-2016.
 *
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_AIRTIME_FAIRNESS: Driver supports getting airtime
 *	fairness for transmitted packets and has enabled airtime fairness
 *	scheduling.
 *
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_AP_PMKSA_CACHING: Driver/device supports PMKSA caching
 *	(set/del PMKSA operations) in AP mode.
 *
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_SCHED_SCAN_BAND_SPECIFIC_RSSI_THOLD: Driver supports
 *	filtering of sched scan results using band specific RSSI thresholds.
 *
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_STA_TX_PWR: This driver supports controlling tx power
 *	to a station.
 *
 * @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_SAE_OFFLOAD: Device wants to do SAE authentication in
 *	station mode (SAE password is passed as part of the connect command).
 *
 * @NUM_NL80211_EXT_FEATURES: number of extended features.
 * @MAX_NL80211_EXT_FEATURES: highest extended feature index.
